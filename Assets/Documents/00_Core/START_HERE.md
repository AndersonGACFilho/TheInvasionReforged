# Week 1 - Let's Build This Thing

**Week:** Nov 4-10, 2025  
**Phase:** Art Production  
**Goal:** Get the core visual style nailed down

---

## This Week's Work

You're building the foundation. By Friday, you should have:
- Player ship model that looks alien and badass
- Three enemy types that feel distinct
- A VHS filter that screams "1980s arcade"
- Unity project set up and ready

---

## Monday-Tuesday: Player Ship

**Goal:** The hero of your game (12 hours)

Create the alien ship that players will pilot:
- 800-1500 triangles (keep it low-poly)
- Geometric, angular design (think Defender meets Geometry Wars)
- Cyan (#00FFCC) base color with magenta (#FF00FF) glowing bits
- Should look fast even when standing still

**Test:** Import to Unity. Does it feel right at 1/10th scale? Good.

---

## Wednesday: Light Enemies

**Goal:** Swarm ships that die fast (14 hours)

Build three enemy types:

**Falcon Mk I** (8 hours)
- 500-800 tris
- Small, wedge-shaped
- Designed to attack in groups
- Red warning lights

**Sentry-03** (6 hours)
- 400-700 tris
- Spherical drone with rotating parts
- Fires from a distance
- Orange highlights

Start on **Atlas** if you have time:
- 1000-1500 tris
- Heavy, slow, intimidating
- Finish Thursday morning

---

## Thursday: VHS Filter + Atlas

**Morning:** Finish Atlas heavy bomber

**Afternoon:** VHS Post-Processing (8 hours)
- Scanlines (horizontal, subtle)
- Chromatic aberration (red/blue separation)
- CRT curvature (barely noticeable)
- Color bleeding effect
- Test with all models

**Goal:** Should look like you're playing on a CRT TV in 1987, not broken.

---

## Friday: Unity Setup

**Morning:** Project Configuration (6 hours)
- Install Unity 2022.3 LTS
- Set up Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- Install Post-Processing package
- Import all models
- Set up Git (don't lose your work!)

**Afternoon:** Test & Adjust
- Place models in scene
- Apply VHS filter
- Take screenshots
- Tweak colors/effects if needed

---

## How to Know You're Done

By end of week you should have:
- ✅ Models look low-poly on purpose (not just unfinished)
- ✅ VHS filter makes it feel retro, not glitchy
- ✅ Colors pop even with the filter on
- ✅ Everything's in Unity and Git
- ✅ You can show someone a screenshot and they get it

## If You Get Stuck

**Models looking too detailed?** 
→ Read [LOW_POLY_VHS_GUIDE.md](../01_Domain/Technical/LOW_POLY_VHS_GUIDE.md)

**Not sure what the game is?**  
→ Skim [GDD.md](../01_Domain/Design/GDD.md) Sections 1-3

**VHS filter looking wrong?**  
→ Reference 1980s arcade games (Defender, Tempest, Battlezone)

**Running behind?**  
→ Cut corners on Atlas, finish it Monday

## Next Week Preview

Week 2 (Nov 11-17):
- Heavy enemy variants
- Boss model (big one - 2000-3000 tris)
- Start mobile controls prototype
- Materials and textures

---

## Reference Materials

**For Art:**
- [LOW_POLY_VHS_GUIDE.md](../01_Domain/Technical/LOW_POLY_VHS_GUIDE.md)
- GDD Section 2 (Arenas), Section 4 (Weapons), Section 5 (Enemies)

**For Schedule:**
- [MASTER_PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE.md](../02_Production/Schedule/MASTER_PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE.md)

---

## Reality Check

This is doable in 40-50 hours. That's 6-7 hours a day, 6 days a week, with Sunday off.

If you're working less, adjust expectations. If you're working more, don't burn out Week 1.

The goal isn't perfection. The goal is getting the style down so you can iterate fast later.

**Now stop reading and start modeling.**
