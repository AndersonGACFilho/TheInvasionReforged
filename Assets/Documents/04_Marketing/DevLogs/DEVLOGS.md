# Devlogs Strategy

Guide for making dev logs (YouTube + LinkedIn) that build audience and get wishlists.

Checklist (what I'll include)
- Devlog goals and KPIs
- Cadence and publishing schedule
- Video structure and episode ideas aligned with the GDD
- Recording, editing, and thumbnail best practices
- YouTube upload checklist and description template
- LinkedIn post template and repurposing plan
- Short script templates and example first-devlog script
- Metrics to track and next steps

---

## Goals & KPIs
- Primary goals: Gain visibility, build trust around the solo dev story, generate Steam wishlists and mobile pre-orders.
- Audience goals (first 3 months): 500 YouTube subscribers, 2k combined views across platform, 1k Steam wishlists (or equivalent).
- Key metrics to track: views, average view duration, click-through rate (CTR on thumbnail), engagement (likes/comments/shares), subscribers gained per video, Steam wishlist conversion, LinkedIn impressions & engagement.

---

## Cadence & Schedule
- Frequency: Weekly or bi-weekly (weekly recommended during early dev for momentum).
- Duration: 5–12 minutes for full devlogs. Create 30–90s teaser clips for LinkedIn and short-form platforms.
- Suggested publishing day/time: Tuesday or Thursday, 10–11 AM local time (experiment and iterate).

Example 8-episode devlog plan aligned to your GDD timeline
- Devlog 00 — Intro: Solo dev + high concept + roadmap (publish with GDD announcement)
- Devlog 01 — Movement & Core Shooting Mechanics (Week 1 demo)
- Devlog 02 — Enemy AI: Falcon Mk I & Sentry-03 (Week 1/2 demo)
- Devlog 03 — Leveling & Temporary Upgrades (Week 2 demo)
- Devlog 04 — Hangar & Permanent Upgrades (Week 3 demo)
- Devlog 05 — Quantum Entropy Matrix Deep Dive (mechanics + design rationale)
- Devlog 06 — Boss Design: Prometheus (design + prototype footage)
- Devlog 07 — Polishing, mobile optimizations, and next milestones (release roadmap + wishlist CTA)

---

## Video Structure (repeatable format)
1. Hook (0:00–0:15) — short visual tease: highlight the coolest/most surprising moment. One-sentence value: "Today I implemented the Quantum Entropy Matrix that increases rare drop chances."
2. Intro (0:15–0:35) — 5–10s personal intro, project name, episode number.
3. Progress demo (0:35–4:00+) — show gameplay or editor, explain what you changed. Keep camera/gameplay focused, use captions.
4. Deep dive (2–5 minutes) — code/design decisions, trade-offs, short diagrams or clips of editor/config files.
5. Problems & learnings (30–60s) — what failed, how you fixed (brevity = authenticity).
6. Roadmap & next steps (20–40s) — what’s next and when the next devlog will be.
7. CTA (10–20s) — wishlist on Steam, follow on YouTube/LinkedIn, subscribe, join Discord.
8. End slate (5–10s) — social links and short music sting.

Tips: keep energy up, speak to camera occasionally for personality, add captions for accessibility, show a short timelapse for long processes.

## Recording & Editing Best Practices
- Video: 1920x1080 (60fps if gameplay looks smooth), use a capture bitrate of 10–20 Mbps for clear footage.
- Audio: use a USB/XLR microphone with pop filter. Record audio at 44.1/48 kHz, 16–24 bit. Normalize and apply light compression & noise gate.
- Webcam: optional, 720p minimum, place a small rounded webcam overlay.
- Screen recording: record game 1080p; if possible, record editor windows separately for cutaways.
- Editing software: DaVinci Resolve (free), Premiere Pro, or CapCut for mobile edits.
- Editing checklist: trim dead air, add captions, add lower-thirds with episode number, include music (royalty-free), color grade gameplay for consistency, export H.264 MP4.

---

## Thumbnail & Title Guidelines
- Resolution: 1280x720 (16:9). Keep important details inside a safe area (center 90%).
- Design: bold readable text (30–60 px), high-contrast colors, big expressive face if using webcam, one dominant visual action from the game.
- Text examples: "Building Quantum Loot Mechanics", "How I Made the Prometheus Boss", "Movement + Zero-G Inertia Explained".
- Title formula: [Devlog #X] Short hook — The Invasion Reforged. Example: "Devlog #03 — Building Level-Up Loot Choices — The Invasion Reforged"

---

## YouTube Upload Checklist & Description Template
- Upload checklist: craft a strong title, add compelling thumbnail, set visibility (public/scheduled), add tags, add chapters in description, add pinned comment linking to Steam wishlist/Discord, add end screen linking to playlist or subscribe, add card to related videos, add subtitles (auto-generated then fix), schedule cross-post on LinkedIn.

YouTube description template (editable):

Devlog #01 — Movement & Auto-Fire

Short summary: In this devlog I implement zero-g movement with slight inertia and the game's auto-fire system. You'll see gameplay footage, code snippets, and notes on tuning.

## LinkedIn Post Template & Strategy
- Post type: short native video (30–90s) + short text body. On LinkedIn, short & insightful posts perform best. Also publish a longer article for larger lessons or case studies.
- Frequency: 1–2 short posts per week (teasers + lessons), 1 longer article every 2–4 weeks.
- Engagement strategy: tag relevant people/companies, use 3–6 hashtags (#GameDev, #IndieDev, #MadeWithUnity, #MobileGames), ask one open question to invite comments.

LinkedIn post template (short):
```
Devlog #01 — Movement & Auto-Fire (Teaser)

Implemented zero-g movement with slight inertia today. Small change but huge for how the game feels. 

Lesson: tune acceleration and drag values to keep movement responsive but "floaty".

```

For full-text articles: expand on design trade-offs or technical deep dives (use diagrams and code snippets). Link back to the video and GDD stored in the repo.

---

## Repurposing Strategy
- Create 3 short clips (15–60s) per devlog: gameplay highlight, biggest learning, and a code/design insight. Use these on LinkedIn, Instagram Reels, TikTok.
- Post the short native video on LinkedIn for better reach than external links.
- Post a pinned tweet/X with short clip + YouTube link and relevant hashtags.

---

## Script Templates
Short outline (for 5–8 minute video):
- Hook (1 line)
- Intro (name + project + episode)
- Problem/goal for this session
- Demo: show before/after
- How it’s implemented (high-level code/design)
- What broke & how I fixed it
- Next steps + CTA

Example full micro-script (first devlog intro):
```
[Hook] I just implemented the zero-G movement and it finally feels right — here's why.

Hi, I'm [Your Name], solo dev of The Invasion Reforged. This is Devlog #01.

Goal today: add inertia to movement and tweak auto-fire so enemies feel threatening.

Demo: (play footage) — you can see how the ship drifts and requires small corrections.

Implementation: I used a simple dampened velocity model and clamped top speed. I prioritized feel over realistic physics because responsiveness is critical for fun.

Problems: initial tuning made the ship feel sluggish; solved by adjusting the acceleration curve and adding a short dash ability.

Next: work on enemy AI and initial level spawns. If you want the build, wishlist on Steam at: <link>.

## Example First Devlog Title, Description, and Hashtags
- Title: "Devlog #01 — Zero-G Movement & Auto-Fire — The Invasion Reforged"
- Short description: "In this devlog I implement inertia-based ship movement and the automatic weapon system. Watch gameplay, code notes, and tuning decisions."
- Hashtags: #GameDev #IndieDev #Roguelite #Unity #TheInvasionReforged

---

## Metrics & Iteration
- Track these per-episode: Views, watch time %, CTR, likes, comments, subscribers, Steam wishlist clicks.
- After 3 videos, analyze which topics drove the most engagement and prioritize similar content.

---

## Next Steps I can help with (pick any)
- Generate a full script for Devlog #01 (I can produce a timed script with VO lines and cut points).
- Create a thumbnail mockup spec or produce example thumbnail text options.
- Produce the YouTube description and LinkedIn post copy for Devlog #01.
- Create short clip variants (15–60s) from an uploaded video (if you provide footage).
- Add this DEVLOGS.md into your repository (done).

If you want, tell me which next step to do and I will implement it now.
