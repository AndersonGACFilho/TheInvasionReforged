# Shorts Scripts - The Invasion Reforged

Three production-ready short scripts (vertical format) with titles, descriptions, comments, hashtags, thumbnails, and CTAs.

Replace `<STEAM_WISHLIST>`, `<DISCORD_INVITE>`, and `<FULL_DEVLOG_URL>` with real links before uploading.

---

## Strategy

Shorts are the main discovery channel. Post 2-3 per week and extract extras from long devlogs. Pair with bi-weekly or monthly full devlogs.

Track: views, avg view duration, completion rate, subscriber conversions, wishlist clicks, likes, comments, shares, retention.

UPLOAD & POSTING NOTES

- Add a short chapter marker in the YouTube description for clarity (e.g., 0:00 Hook, 0:03 Demo, 0:12 CTA).
- Add subtitles (auto-gen then correct) and upload a vertical thumbnail when possible.

SUGGESTED CADENCE
- Minimum: 2 shorts/week (Tue/Thu) + 1 long devlog every 2–4 weeks.
- Recommended: 3 shorts/week (Tue/Thu/Sat) + 1 long devlog every 2 weeks.

MONITORING & ITERATION

NEXT ACTIONS I CAN DO NOW
- Write the full timed VO/script for Devlog #01 long form.
- Create `Assets/Documents/Planning/SHORTS.md` (this file created).
- Generate thumbnail text mockups or overlay specs for each short.
- Produce YouTube description + LinkedIn post copy for the first short and commit to repo.

If you want the full timed VO/script for Devlog #01 or thumbnail text mockups next, tell me which and I'll add them to the repo.
