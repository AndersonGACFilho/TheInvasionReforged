+# Features - Post-Launch & Future Development
+
+**Bounded Context:** Feature-specific implementations and enhancements
+
+---
+
+## 📂 Structure
+
+```
+03_Features/
+└── Leaderboard/                          # Post-Launch Feature (Week 22-24)
+    ├── LEADERBOARD_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md
+    ├── LEADERBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
+    └── LEADERBOARD_QUICK_REF.md
+```
+
+---
+
+## Purpose
+
+This bounded context contains **feature-specific documentation** for:
+
+- Post-launch content (Week 22+)
+- Future enhancements
+- Experimental features
+- Modular systems
+
+Each feature is a **sub-domain** with its own:
+- Architecture diagrams
+- Implementation guides
+- API documentation
+- Testing strategies
+
+---
+
+## 📋 Feature Catalog
+
+### Planned Features
+
+#### **Leaderboard System** (Week 22-24)
+**Status:** Design complete, awaiting implementation  
+**Priority:** High (drives engagement & replayability)
+
+**Documents:**
+- [ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md](Leaderboard/LEADERBOARD_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md) - System design
+- [IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](Leaderboard/LEADERBOARD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md) - Step-by-step guide
+- [QUICK_REF.md](Leaderboard/LEADERBOARD_QUICK_REF.md) - API reference
+
+**Key Features:**
+- Global leaderboards (by ship type)
+- Daily/weekly/all-time rankings
+- Friend comparisons
+- Score submission & validation
+- Anti-cheat measures
+
+---
+
+## 🧩 Feature Development Standards
+
+### Documentation Requirements
+Each new feature must include:
+1. **Architecture Diagram** - System design (Mermaid preferred)
+2. **Implementation Summary** - How to build it
+3. **Quick Reference** - API & usage guide
+4. **Test Plan** - Unit & integration tests
+
+### DDD Principles for Features
+
+#### Bounded Context Isolation
+- Features are **separate subdomains** with clear boundaries
+- Minimal coupling to core game systems
+- Use **domain events** for communication
+
+#### Example: Leaderboard as Subdomain
+```
+Core Game Domain ──(event)──► Leaderboard Subdomain
+                 "RunCompleted"
+                                ↓
+                         Score Validation
+                                ↓
+                         Backend Submission
+```
+
+#### Anti-Corruption Layer
+Features interact with core systems through **interfaces**:
+```csharp
+// Core game doesn't know about leaderboards
+public interface IScoreSubmitter
+{
+    void SubmitScore(RunResult result);
+}
+
+// Leaderboard implements the interface
+public class LeaderboardSubmitter : IScoreSubmitter
+{
+    // Backend logic isolated here
+}
+```
+
+---
+
+## Roadmap
+
+### Phase 1: Launch (Week 17)
+**Scope:** Core game only, no post-launch features
+
+### Phase 2: Post-Launch Content (Week 18-21)
+- Bug fixes & balancing
+- Community feedback integration
+- Minor content additions
+
+### Phase 3: Leaderboards (Week 22-24)
+- Global ranking system
+- Steam integration
+- Anti-cheat measures
+
+### Phase 4: Future (TBD)
+**Potential Features:**
+- Daily challenges
+- New ship types
+- Boss rush mode
+- Cosmetic unlocks
+- Co-op mode (multiplayer architecture ready!)
+
+---
+
+## 📝 Adding a New Feature
+
+### 1. Create Feature Folder
+``` 
+mkdir "03_Features\NewFeatureName"
+```
+
+### 2. Create Documentation
+```
+03_Features\NewFeatureName\
+├── README.md                          # Overview & purpose
+├── ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md            # System design
+├── IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md            # How to build
+└── API_REFERENCE.md                   # Usage & integration
+```
+
+### 3. Follow DDD Principles
+- Define **ubiquitous language** for the feature
+- Identify **entities** and **value objects**
+- Design **aggregates** and **repositories**
+- Map **domain events** for integration
+
+### 4. Implement with Tests
+- Write unit tests first (TDD)
+- Ensure 90%+ code coverage
+- Integration tests for core interaction
+- End-to-end tests for user flows
+
+---
+
+**Last Updated:** November 4, 2025  
+**Next Feature Review:** Week 18 (Post-Launch)

+# Week 1 - Let's Build This Thing
+
+**Week:** Nov 4-10, 2025  
+**Phase:** Art Production  
+**Goal:** Get the core visual style nailed down
+
+---
+
+## This Week's Work
+
+You're building the foundation. By Friday, you should have:
+- Player ship model that looks alien and badass
+- Three enemy types that feel distinct
+- A VHS filter that screams "1980s arcade"
+- Unity project set up and ready
+
+---
+
+## Monday-Tuesday: Player Ship
+
+**Goal:** The hero of your game (12 hours)
+
+Create the alien ship that players will pilot:
+- 800-1500 triangles (keep it low-poly)
+- Geometric, angular design (think Defender meets Geometry Wars)
+- Cyan (#00FFCC) base color with magenta (#FF00FF) glowing bits
+- Should look fast even when standing still
+
+**Test:** Import to Unity. Does it feel right at 1/10th scale? Good.
+
+---
+
+## Wednesday: Light Enemies
+
+**Goal:** Swarm ships that die fast (14 hours)
+
+Build three enemy types:
+
+**Falcon Mk I** (8 hours)
+- 500-800 tris
+- Small, wedge-shaped
+- Designed to attack in groups
+- Red warning lights
+
+**Sentry-03** (6 hours)
+- 400-700 tris
+- Spherical drone with rotating parts
+- Fires from a distance
+- Orange highlights
+
+Start on **Atlas** if you have time:
+- 1000-1500 tris
+- Heavy, slow, intimidating
+- Finish Thursday morning
+
+---
+
+## Thursday: VHS Filter + Atlas
+
+**Morning:** Finish Atlas heavy bomber
+
+**Afternoon:** VHS Post-Processing (8 hours)
+- Scanlines (horizontal, subtle)
+- Chromatic aberration (red/blue separation)
+- CRT curvature (barely noticeable)
+- Color bleeding effect
+- Test with all models
+
+**Goal:** Should look like you're playing on a CRT TV in 1987, not broken.
+
+---
+
+## Friday: Unity Setup
+
+**Morning:** Project Configuration (6 hours)
+- Install Unity 2022.3 LTS
+- Set up Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
+- Install Post-Processing package
+- Import all models
+- Set up Git (don't lose your work!)
+
+**Afternoon:** Test & Adjust
+- Place models in scene
+- Apply VHS filter
+- Take screenshots
+- Tweak colors/effects if needed
+
+---
+
+## How to Know You're Done
+
+By end of week you should have:
+- ✅ Models look low-poly on purpose (not just unfinished)
+- ✅ VHS filter makes it feel retro, not glitchy
+- ✅ Colors pop even with the filter on
+- ✅ Everything's in Unity and Git
+- ✅ You can show someone a screenshot and they get it
+
+---
+
+## If You Get Stuck
+
+**Models looking too detailed?** 
+→ Read [LOW_POLY_VHS_GUIDE.md](../01_Domain/Technical/LOW_POLY_VHS_GUIDE.md)
+
+**Not sure what the game is?**  
+→ Skim [GDD.md](../01_Domain/Design/GDD.md) Sections 1-3
+
+**VHS filter looking wrong?**  
+→ Reference 1980s arcade games (Defender, Tempest, Battlezone)
+
+**Running behind?**  
+→ Cut corners on Atlas, finish it Monday
+
+---
+
+## Next Week Preview
+
+Week 2 (Nov 11-17):
+- Heavy enemy variants
+- Boss model (big one - 2000-3000 tris)
+- Start mobile controls prototype
+- Materials and textures
+
+---
+
+## Reference Materials
+
+**For Art:**
+- [LOW_POLY_VHS_GUIDE.md](../01_Domain/Technical/LOW_POLY_VHS_GUIDE.md)
+- GDD Section 2 (Arenas), Section 4 (Weapons), Section 5 (Enemies)
+
+**For Schedule:**
+- [MASTER_PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE.md](../02_Production/Schedule/MASTER_PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE.md)
+
+---
+
+## Reality Check
+
+This is doable in 40-50 hours. That's 6-7 hours a day, 6 days a week, with Sunday off.
+
+If you're working less, adjust expectations. If you're working more, don't burn out Week 1.
+
+The goal isn't perfection. The goal is getting the style down so you can iterate fast later.
+
+---
+
+**Now stop reading and start modeling.**

+# Devlog #01 — Roteiro de Gravação VO (Português - pt-BR)
+
+Use este arquivo para gravar a versão em Português do VO. Cada seção foi dividida para facilitar a gravação e edição.
+
+0:00–0:08 Gancho (8s)
+"Movimento em gravidade zero ativado — e finalmente está com a sensação certa."
+
+0:08–0:25 Introdução (17s)
+"Olá, eu sou [Seu Nome], desenvolvedor solo de The Invasion Reforged. Bem-vindo ao Devlog número um. Hoje vou ajustar o movimento da nave e as armas de disparo automático."
+
+0:25–0:45 Objetivo & Contexto (20s)
+"Objetivo desta sessão: adicionar inércia para uma sensação flutuante, mas responsiva, e fazer as armas automáticas funcionarem de maneira que recompense posicionamento e escolhas de upgrades."
+
+0:45–2:10 Deep Dive do Movimento (grave em linhas curtas)
+"Modelei o movimento como um sistema de velocidade amortecida."
+"Ao invés de definir a velocidade diretamente, a nave acelera em direção à entrada e a velocidade existente é amortecida a cada frame."
+"Principais parâmetros: curva de aceleração, fator de amortecimento e limite de velocidade máxima."
+"Usei uma curva de aceleração não-linear para que pequenos inputs sejam ágeis, enquanto um input sustentado atinge a velocidade máxima de forma suave."
+
+2:10–2:45 Explicação da Habilidade Dash (35s)
+"Para complementar a inércia, adicionei uma dash curta com tempo de recarga."
+"Isso preserva o risco — você não pode usar a dash sem limite — mas dá ao jogador uma opção de emergência para evitar interceptores kamikaze."
+
+2:45–3:45 Armas de Tiro Automático (1:00)
+"As armas disparam automaticamente com base no seu loadout e nível."
+"O sistema escolhe alvos dentro de um cone e dispara conforme as taxas específicas de cada arma."
+"É orientado por dados: novas armas são definidas por ScriptableObjects ou JSON que especificam taxa de disparo, ângulo do cone, tipo de projétil e escala com o nível."
+
+3:45–4:10 Interação com Upgrades (25s)
+"Quando você sobe de nível, upgrades temporários podem mudar o comportamento das suas armas automáticas — por exemplo, adicionando homing ou criando um orbitador."
+"Essas mudanças temporárias se combinam com os upgrades permanentes do Hangar."
+
+4:10–4:40 Problemas & Correções (30s)
+"Na primeira versão, o movimento ficou lento."
+"Aumentei a responsividade ajustando a curva de aceleração e adicionei a dash para melhorar a agência do jogador."
+"Para as armas, ajustei o spread dos projéteis e adicionei escala por nível para evitar picos de poder no início."
+
+4:40–5:10 Trecho de Jogabilidade (30s)
+(Comentário ao vivo opcional — mantenha curto)
+"Aqui está um run onde as pequenas correções importam — veja o Raven-IX se aproximando e a dash que salva a nave."
+

+# Devlog #01 — VO Recording Script (English)
+
+Use this file as a line-by-line script for recording your English voice-over. Each section is short for easy recording and editing.
+
+0:00–0:08 Hook (8s)
+"Zero‑G movement is live — and it finally feels right."
+
+0:08–0:25 Intro (17s)
+"Hi, I'm [Your Name], solo dev of The Invasion Reforged. Welcome to Devlog number one. Today I'm tuning ship movement and the auto-fire weapons."
+
+0:25–0:45 Goal & Context (20s)
+"Goal for this session: add inertia for a floaty-but-responsive feel, and get the automatic weapons firing in a way that rewards positioning and upgrades."
+
+0:45–2:10 Movement Deep Dive (record as short lines)
+"I modeled movement as a dampened velocity system."
+"Instead of directly setting velocity, the ship accelerates toward input and existing velocity is dampened each frame."
+"Key tuning knobs are: the acceleration curve, the damping factor, and a top speed clamp."
+"I used a non-linear acceleration curve so small inputs feel snappy while sustained input reaches top speed smoothly."
+
+2:10–2:45 Dash Ability Explanation (35s)
+"To complement inertia, I added a short dash with a cooldown."
+"This preserves risk — you can't spam the dash — while giving players a clutch option to avoid kamikaze interceptors."
+
+2:45–3:45 Auto-Fire Weapons (1:00)
+"Weapons fire automatically based on your current loadout and level."
+"The system chooses targets within a cone and fires according to weapon-specific rates."
+"It's data-driven: new weapons are defined by ScriptableObjects or JSON configs that set fire rate, cone angle, projectile type, and scaling with level."
+
+3:45–4:10 Upgrade Interaction (25s)
+"When you level up, temporary run upgrades can change how your auto-weapons behave — for example, adding homing or creating an orbiter."
+"These temporary changes stack with permanent Hangar upgrades."
+
+4:10–4:40 Problem & Fixes (30s)
+"Initial tuning made the ship feel sluggish."
+"I increased responsiveness by adjusting the acceleration curve and added the dash to improve player agency."
+"For weapons, I adjusted projectile spread and added level-scaling to avoid huge power spikes early."
+
+4:40–5:10 Live Playthrough Clip (30s)
+(Optional live commentary — keep short)
+"Here's a run where small corrections matter — watch the Raven-IX approach and the dash that saves the ship."
+
+5:10–5:40 Next Steps & Roadmap (30s)
+"Next: enemy AI for Raven-IX, level spawn tuning, and the Hangar with permanent upgrades."
+"Devlog number two will focus on enemy AI and spawn design."
+
+5:40–6:00 End & CTA (20s)
+"If you liked this, wishlist The Invasion Reforged and subscribe for weekly devlogs."
+"Full devlog and code notes are in the description. Thanks for watching!"

+## Production Philosophy
+
+### Art-First Approach
+Unlike traditional gamedev (code → prototype → polish art), this project prioritizes:
+1. **Complete art production first** (Weeks 1-6)
+2. **Implement with polished assets** (Weeks 7-14)
+3. **Market with professional visuals** (Weeks 15-17)
+
+**Rationale:**
+- DevLogs need polished visuals 2-3 weeks before launch
+- Beautiful assets motivate better coding
+- Art scope locks early, preventing feature creep
+- Clean architecture easier without time pressure
+
+### Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
+**MASTER_PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE.md** is the authoritative timeline:
+- All dates, tasks, and deliverables reference this document
+- No conflicting schedules in other docs
+- Updated weekly during production

+- Check for regressions from the week
+- Document any issues in Git commit
+
+**Before Milestones:**
+- Week 6 (Art Lock): Profile with all assets loaded
+- Week 10 (First Playable): Full gameplay profiling
+- Week 14 (Code Complete): Final optimization pass
+- Week 16 (Release Candidate): Platform-specific testing
+
+### Profiling Tools
+
+**Unity Profiler (Primary):**
+- CPU Usage (frame time breakdown)
+- GPU Usage (draw calls, vertices)
+- Memory (allocations, GC spikes)
+- Rendering (batching, overdraw)
+
+**Platform-Specific:**
+- **PC:** NVIDIA Nsight (GPU), Intel VTune (CPU)
+- **iOS:** Xcode Instruments
+- **Android:** Android Profiler, Snapdragon Profiler
+
+### Performance Testing Scenarios
+
+**Standard Scenario (Baseline):**
+- Player ship active
+- 10 enemies on screen
+- 3 weapon systems firing
+- 5 particle effects active
+- UI elements visible
+
+**Stress Test (Maximum Load):**
+- Player ship + boss
+- 20 enemies on screen
+- All weapon systems firing
+- 15 particle effects active
+- UI + debug overlays
+
+**Mobile-Specific Tests:**
+- 30-minute battery drain test
+- Thermal throttling (20-minute sustained gameplay)
+- Background/foreground switching
+- Low-memory devices (iPhone 8, Galaxy A32)
+
+---
+
+## ⚡ Optimization Priorities
+
+### Phase 1: Art Production (Weeks 1-6)
+
+**Priority: Asset Optimization**
+- Keep triangle counts within budget
+- Use texture atlases where possible
+- Test VHS filter performance early (Week 3)
+- Profile with 10+ models on screen
+
+**Deliverable (Week 6):**
+- All assets meet triangle budget
+- VHS filter runs at 60 FPS on target hardware
+- Draw calls < 200 in test scene
+
+### Phase 2: Gameplay Implementation (Weeks 7-14)
+
+**Priority: Runtime Performance**
+- Object pooling for enemies/projectiles (Week 7)
+- AI optimization (LOD for distant enemies) (Week 8)
+- GC allocation reduction (Week 10)
+- Mobile build performance parity (Week 12)
+
+**Deliverable (Week 14):**
+- PC: Stable 60 FPS with 20 enemies
+- Mobile: Stable 30 FPS on mid-range devices
+- Zero memory leaks (30-minute test)
+
+### Phase 3: Launch Polish (Weeks 15-17)
+
+**Priority: Platform Optimization**
+- iOS/Android certification compliance
+- Battery optimization
+- Loading time reduction
+- Build size optimization
+
+**Deliverable (Week 17):**
+- All targets met (see tables above)
+- No performance regressions from Week 14
+
+---
+
+## 🚨 Performance Red Flags
+
+### Immediate Action Required If:
+
+1. **Frame time exceeds 20ms (50 FPS)** on target hardware
+   - **Action:** Profile immediately, identify bottleneck
+   - **Escalation:** Consider cutting features if not fixable in 2 days
+
+2. **Memory exceeds 3GB on PC** or **2GB on mobile**
+   - **Action:** Check for leaks, reduce texture sizes
+   - **Escalation:** May need to reduce asset quality
+
+3. **Draw calls exceed 500 (PC)** or **200 (mobile)**
+   - **Action:** Implement batching, reduce materials
+   - **Escalation:** May need to simplify visual effects
+
+4. **Build size exceeds 800MB (PC)** or **300MB (mobile)**
+   - **Action:** Compress assets, remove unused resources
+   - **Escalation:** Consider asset streaming
+
+5. **Load time exceeds 10 seconds** anywhere
+   - **Action:** Profile asset loading, implement async loading
+   - **Escalation:** May need loading screen optimization
+
+---
+
+## 📱 Mobile-Specific Considerations
+
+### Battery Optimization
+
+**Techniques:**
+- Reduce target frame rate to 30 FPS (mobile default)
+- Implement frame rate throttling when idle
+- Reduce particle counts on mobile
+- Lower texture resolution
+- Disable expensive post-processing (VHS filter intensity)
+
+**Testing:**
+- 30-minute continuous play should use < 20% battery
+- Monitor thermal throttling on devices
+- Test with "Low Power Mode" enabled (iOS)
+
+### Device Tier System
+
+**Implementation (Week 12):**
+```csharp
+public enum DeviceTier
+{
+    High,    // 60 FPS, full VHS filter, max particles
+    Medium,  // 30 FPS, reduced VHS filter, reduced particles
+    Low      // 30 FPS, minimal VHS filter, minimal particles
+}
+```
+
+**Auto-Detection:**
+- Use `SystemInfo.processorFrequency` and `SystemInfo.systemMemorySize`
+- Benchmark first 5 seconds of gameplay
+- Adjust quality based on detected performance
+
+---
+
+## 🎯 Optimization Techniques Approved for This Project
+
+### Rendering Optimization
+
+✅ **GPU Instancing** for repeated enemies (Falcon swarms)  
+✅ **Static Batching** for environment props  
+✅ **Texture Atlasing** for UI elements  
+✅ **Occlusion Culling** for arena boundaries (if needed)  
+✅ **LOD Groups** for boss model only (if mobile struggles)  
+
+❌ **Dynamic Batching** - Not needed with low draw calls  
+❌ **Lightmapping** - Real-time lighting is fine for this aesthetic  
+
+### Gameplay Optimization
+
+✅ **Object Pooling** for projectiles, enemies, particles  
+✅ **Spatial Partitioning** (simple grid) for collision detection (if > 50 entities)  
+✅ **Fixed Update Intervals** for AI (not every frame)  
+
+❌ **ECS/DOTS** - Overkill for this scope, SOLID is sufficient  
+
+### Memory Optimization
+
+✅ **Asset Bundles** for arenas (load/unload per level)  
+✅ **Texture Streaming** if build size exceeds 500MB  
+✅ **Audio Streaming** for music  
+
+❌ **Aggressive GC** tuning - Unity 2022.3 handles this well

+- [ ] Performance validated on 10+ mobile devices
+- [ ] Zero performance-related bug reports in beta
+
+---
+
+## 🆘 Performance Emergency Protocol
+
+If performance targets are not met by Week 14:
+
+**Tier 1 Cuts (Minimal Impact):**
+- Reduce max enemies from 20 → 15
+- Reduce particle counts by 30%
+- Lower VHS filter quality on mobile
+
+**Tier 2 Cuts (Moderate Impact):**
+- Remove 2 arenas (launch with 3 instead of 5)
+- Simplify boss to single-phase
+- Delay mobile launch to Week 19
+
+**Tier 3 Cuts (High Impact - Avoid if possible):**
+- Reduce enemy types from 5 → 3
+- Remove temporary upgrade system complexity
+- PC-only launch (no mobile)
+
+**Decision Point:** Week 13 (give 1 week to fix before escalating)

+# Production Schedule - Early Access
+
+**Project:** The Invasion Reforged  
+**Strategy:** Early Access → Full Release  
+**EA Launch:** 14 Weeks (Nov 4, 2025 → Feb 16, 2026)  
+**Full Release:** Week 25+ (Apr 28, 2026+)  
+**Developer:** Anderson Gonçalves (solo)  
+**Weekly Hours:** 40-50 realistic, 60-70 aggressive
+
+---
+
+## How This Works
+
+### Art First
+Make all the art before coding. This gives me polished assets for devlogs 2-3 weeks before launch, when marketing matters most.
+
+### Clean Architecture
+Build everything with multiplayer in mind, even if it ships single-player. Unit tests for everything. SOLID principles.
+
+### Why Early Access
+- Launch 5 weeks sooner
+- Revenue from week 14
+- Player feedback shapes development
+- Multiple marketing moments
+- Less pressure ("more content coming")

+# Low-Poly Retro Art Guide
+
+**Style:** Low-Poly + VHS = Retro Space Arcade  
+**Inspired By:** Star Fox, Devil Daggers, Dusk, Hyperspace Dogfights  
+**Goal:** 80s/90s arcade feel with modern clarity
+
+---
+
+## Visual Pillars
+
+### Low-Poly Modeling
+
+**Triangle Budget:**
+- Player Ship: 800-1500 tris
+- Basic Enemies (Falcon, Sentry, Raven-IX): 400-800 tris
+- Heavy Enemies (Atlas, Aegis): 1000-1500 tris
+- Boss (Prometheus): 2000-3000 tris
+- Props: 100-500 tris each
+
+**Rules:**
+- Sharp angles - no smooth subdivisions
+- Geometric shapes - cubes, pyramids, cylinders
+- Flat shading - no normal maps
+- Bold silhouettes - recognizable from distance
+- Minimal detail - suggestive not realistic
+
+**Do:**
+- Use basic shapes
+- Keep edges hard
+- Embrace facets
+- Design for silhouettes
+- Think "origami spaceship"
+
+**Don't:**
+- Subdivide or smooth
+- Add complex curves
+- Use high-res textures
+- Over-detail models
+- Try for "realistic"
+
+---
+
+## Modeling Examples
+
+### Player Ship (Alien Tech)
+
+```
+Triangle Count: 1200
+Key Features:
+- Pointed cockpit (pyramid)
+- Angular wings (flat planes)
+- Glowing energy core (emissive cube)
+- Engine exhausts (glowing cylinders)
+
+Modeling Steps (Blender):
+1. Start with cube for main body
+2. Extrude and scale to create cockpit point
+3. Add flat planes for wings (no thickness)
+4. Place small cubes/cylinders for details
+5. NO SUBDIVISION - keep everything faceted
+6. UV unwrap (flat colors only)
+```
+
+### Falcon Mk I (Human Fighter)
+
+**Concept:** Triangular fighter, sharp and aggressive
+
+```
+Triangle Count: 600
+Key Features:
+- Triangle-based fuselage
+- Angular wings
+- Visible cockpit (darker color)
+- Engine glow points
+
+Modeling Approach:
+- Literally start with a stretched pyramid
+- Add wing planes
+- Small cubes for cockpit/engines
+- Total time: 30-45 minutes
+```
+
+### Prometheus (Capital Ship Boss)
+
+**Concept:** Massive geometric fortress
+
+```
+Triangle Count: 2500
+Key Features:
+- Large cubic main body
+- Modular attachments (shield generators)
+- Multiple weapon hardpoints
+- Glowing weak points
+
+Construction:
+- Main body: elongated cube
+- Towers: smaller cubes on top
+- Guns: cylinders pointing outward
+- Shields: transparent cubes around weak points
+```
+
+---
+
+## Color Palette (Retro Aesthetic)
+
+### Player/Alien Colors
+```
+Primary:   #00FFCC (Cyan/Teal)      - Ship hull
+Secondary: #FF00FF (Magenta)        - Energy glow
+Accent:    #FFFF00 (Yellow)         - Highlights
+Dark:      #001122 (Deep Blue-Black)- Shadows
+```
+
+### Enemy/Human Colors
+```
+Primary:   #888888 (Gray)           - Hull
+Secondary: #FF3333 (Red)            - Warning lights
+Accent:    #3366FF (Blue)           - Shields
+Dark:      #222222 (Charcoal)       - Details
+```
+
+### Environment Colors
+```
+Space:     #000000 (Black) with slight blue tint
+Nebula:    Gradient from #FF6600 to #FF0066 (Aureon Prime)
+Ice:       #00CCFF to #FFFFFF (Cryovex)
+Lava:      #FF0000 to #FFAA00 (Voltra-9)
+```
+
+**Palette Rules:**
+- **Limited colors** (3-4 per model)
+- **High contrast** (vibrant vs dark)
+- **Flat shading** (no gradients on models)
+- **Emissive materials** for glows
+

+    [SerializeField] private float tiltSpeed = 5f;
+    
+    private Vector2 _moveInput;

+
+## Performance Optimization (Low-Poly Benefits)
+
+### Why Low-Poly is Perfect for Multiplayer
+
+**1. Low Triangle Count = High Performance**
+- Player ship (1200 tris) vs typical game (50,000+ tris)
+- Can render 100+ enemies simultaneously
+- Perfect for wave-based gameplay
+- Mobile-friendly from day one
+
+**2. Simple Materials = Fast Rendering**
+- No complex shaders
+- Minimal texture lookups
+- Fast material switching
+- Low VRAM usage
+
+**3. Network-Friendly**
+- Simple meshes = small asset bundles
+- Flat colors = no texture downloads
+- Fast instantiation
+- Low bandwidth for sync
+
+### Optimization Checklist
+- [ ] All models under triangle budget
+- [ ] Static batching enabled for props
+- [ ] GPU instancing for repeated enemies
+- [ ] Object pooling for projectiles/enemies
+- [ ] LOD not needed (already low-poly!)
+- [ ] Occlusion culling for arena boundaries
+
+---
+
+## Reference Images & Inspirations
+
+### Games to Study
+1. **Star Fox (SNES/N64)** - Low-poly ships, colorful
+2. **Devil Daggers** - Retro FPS, VHS filter, red aesthetic
+3. **Dusk** - Retro shooter, chunky pixels
+4. **Superhot** - Minimalist, low-poly, bold colors
+5. **Hyperspace Dogfights** - Low-poly space combat
+
+### Visual Moodboard

+[80s neon grids]
+[VHS static overlays]
+[Scanline effects]
+[Vibrant vs dark contrast]
+[Faceted low-poly aesthetics]
+```

+
+## Tomorrow's Task (November 4)
+
+### Morning: Blender Setup
+1. Open Blender
+2. Create new project: "TheInvasionReforged_Models"
+3. Set unit scale to match Unity (1 Blender unit = 1 Unity meter)
+4. Create first model: Player ship (800-1500 tris)
+   - Start with cube
+   - Model for 2-3 hours
+   - NO smooth shading
+   - Keep it angular
+
+### Afternoon: Unity VHS Filter
+1. Create new Unity project (URP template)
+2. Install Post-Processing package
+3. Create Global Volume
+4. Add scanlines, chromatic aberration, film grain
+5. Import Blender ship model
+6. Test with flat-shaded material
+7. Screenshot and compare to retro references
+
+### Goal: By end of Day 1
+- [ ] Player ship base mesh complete (Blender)
+- [ ] VHS filter working (Unity)
+- [ ] One screenshot that looks retro/aesthetic
+- [ ] Excited about the visual direction!
+
+---
+
+**Remember: Embrace the low-poly aesthetic. Less is more. Make it look intentionally retro, not accidentally unfinished!**

+# Testing Strategy
+
+**Project:** The Invasion: Reforged  
+**Approach:** TDD + Playtesting  
+**Coverage:** 90%+ for business logic  
+**Updated:** November 3, 2025
+
+---
+
+## Philosophy
+
+### Core Ideas
+
+1. **TDD:** Write tests before code
+2. **Pure C#:** Separate from Unity MonoBehaviours for easy testing
+3. **Fast:** Tests run in under 5 seconds
+4. **Coverage:** 90%+ for core systems
+5. **Automated:** CI/CD runs tests every commit
+
+### Testing Pyramid
+
+```
+       E2E Tests (10%)
+      Full gameplay, platform testing
+      
+    Integration Tests (20%)
+   System interactions, Unity Play Mode
+   
+  Unit Tests (70%)
+ Pure C# logic, fast and isolated
+```
+
+---
+
+## Unit Testing
+
+### What Gets 90%+ Coverage
+
+**Pure C# Systems (100% required)**
+
+**Combat System:**
+```csharp
+// AttackExecutor.cs - Pure C# combat logic
+[Test]
+public void AttackExecutor_DealsDamageCorrectly()
+{
+    // Arrange
+    var attacker = CreateMockAttacker(damage: 10f);
+    var target = CreateMockTarget(health: 100f);
+    var executor = new AttackExecutor(attacker);
+    
+    // Act
+    executor.ExecuteAttack(target);
+    
+    // Assert
+    Assert.AreEqual(90f, target.CurrentHealth);
+}
+
+[Test]
+public void AttackExecutor_RespectsCooldown()
+{
+    var executor = new AttackExecutor(cooldown: 1f);
+    executor.ExecuteAttack(target);
+    
+    bool canAttackImmediately = executor.CanAttack();
+    
+    Assert.IsFalse(canAttackImmediately);
+}
+```
+
+**Stats System:**
+```csharp
+// StatModifierSystem.cs
+[Test]
+public void StatModifier_AppliesAdditiveModifiers()
+{
+    var baseStats = new CharacterStats { Damage = 10f };
+    var modifier = new StatModifier { Type = StatType.Damage, Value = 5f };
+    
+    float result = StatCalculator.ApplyModifiers(baseStats, modifier);
+    
+    Assert.AreEqual(15f, result);
+}
+
+[Test]
+public void StatModifier_AppliesMultiplicativeModifiers()
+{
+    var baseStats = new CharacterStats { Damage = 10f };
+    var modifier = new StatModifier { Type = StatType.Damage, Multiplier = 1.5f };
+    
+    float result = StatCalculator.ApplyModifiers(baseStats, modifier);
+    
+    Assert.AreEqual(15f, result);
+}
+```
+
+**Progression System:**
+```csharp
+// XPSystem.cs
+[Test]
+public void XPSystem_LevelsUpAtThreshold()
+{
+    var xpSystem = new XPSystem(levelUpThreshold: 100);
+    bool leveledUp = xpSystem.AddExperience(100);
+    
+    Assert.IsTrue(leveledUp);
+    Assert.AreEqual(2, xpSystem.CurrentLevel);
+}
+
+[Test]
+public void XPSystem_OverflowXPCarriesOver()
+{
+    var xpSystem = new XPSystem(levelUpThreshold: 100);
+    xpSystem.AddExperience(150);
+    
+    Assert.AreEqual(2, xpSystem.CurrentLevel);
+    Assert.AreEqual(50, xpSystem.CurrentXP);
+}
+```
+
+#### ✅ Strategy Pattern Implementations (80%+ Coverage)
+
+**Movement Strategies:**
+```csharp
+[Test]
+public void MeleeMovementStrategy_StopsAtTargetDistance()
+{
+    var strategy = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<MeleeMovementStrategy>();
+    strategy.stopDistance = 1f;
+    
+    var mockController = new MockMovable();
+    Vector2 selfPos = Vector2.zero;
+    Vector2 targetPos = new Vector2(0.5f, 0); // Within stop distance
+    
+    strategy.ExecuteMovement(selfPos, targetPos, mockController);
+    
+    Assert.IsTrue(mockController.StopCalled);
+}
+```
+
+**Attack Strategies:**
+```csharp
+[Test]
+public void AOEAttackStrategy_HitsMultipleTargets()
+{
+    var strategy = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<AOEAttackStrategy>();
+    strategy.radius = 5f;
+    
+    var targets = CreateMockTargetsInRadius(3);
+    
+    strategy.Execute(attacker, targets);
+    
+    Assert.AreEqual(3, targets.Count(t => t.WasDamaged));
+}
+```
+
+#### ✅ AI State Machine (70%+ Coverage)
+
+```csharp
+[Test]
+public void EnemyAIContext_TransitionsOnHealthThreshold()
+{
+    var context = new EnemyAIContext();
+    context.healthProvider.SetHealth(20); // Low health
+    
+    var state = new EnemyCombatState();
+    state.Enter(context);
+    
+    // Should transition to flee state
+    Assert.IsTrue(context.OnHealthLow.WasInvoked);
+}
+
+[Test]
+public void ChaseState_StopsAtAttackRange()
+{
+    var context = CreateMockContext();
+    var chaseState = new EnemyChaseState();
+    
+    context.targetPosition = Vector2.zero;
+    context.selfPosition = new Vector2(1f, 0); // Within attack range
+    
+    chaseState.UpdateLogic(context);
+    
+    Assert.IsTrue(context.OnTargetInAttackRange.WasInvoked);
+}
+```
+
+### What Doesn't Need Unit Tests
+
+❌ **Unity MonoBehaviour Lifecycle** (Awake, Start, Update)  
+❌ **Inspector-configured values** (test data-driven logic instead)  
+❌ **Simple getters/setters** (no business logic)  
+❌ **Unity API calls** (Transform.position, etc.)  
+
+**Instead:** Test the LOGIC called by MonoBehaviours, not the MonoBehaviours themselves.
+
+---
+
+## 🔗 Integration Testing Strategy
+
+### What Gets Integration Tested (20% of Test Suite)
+
+#### ✅ Unity Play Mode Tests
+
+**System Integration:**
+```csharp
+[UnityTest]
+public IEnumerator PlayerShip_TakeDamage_UpdatesHealthUI()
+{
+    // Arrange
+    var player = InstantiatePlayer();
+    var ui = GameObject.Find("HealthBar").GetComponent<HealthBarUI>();
+    
+    // Act
+    player.GetComponent<IDamageable>().TakeDamage(10f);
+    yield return null; // Wait one frame
+    
+    // Assert
+    Assert.AreEqual(90f, ui.DisplayedHealth);
+}
+
+[UnityTest]
+public IEnumerator EnemySpawner_SpawnsEnemiesOverTime()
+{
+    var spawner = CreateSpawner();
+    spawner.spawnInterval = 1f;
+    
+    yield return new WaitForSeconds(2.5f);
+    
+    int enemyCount = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("Enemy").Length;
+    Assert.AreEqual(2, enemyCount);
+}
+```
+
+**Combat Integration:**
+```csharp
+[UnityTest]
+public IEnumerator PlayerWeapon_DestroyEnemyOnKill()
+{
+    var player = InstantiatePlayer();
+    var enemy = InstantiateEnemy();
+    enemy.GetComponent<CharacterManager>().SetHealth(10f);
+    
+    // Player deals 10 damage
+    player.GetComponent<PlayerCombatManager>().Attack(enemy);
+    
+    yield return new WaitForSeconds(0.5f);
+    
+    Assert.IsNull(enemy); // Enemy should be destroyed
+}
+```
+
+#### ✅ Multi-System Interactions
+
+**Progression → UI:**
+- Leveling up shows correct UI animation
+- XP bar updates correctly
+- Upgrade choices display properly
+
+**AI → Combat → Movement:**
+- Enemy chases player
+- Enemy stops at attack range
+- Enemy attacks with correct cooldown
+
+**Save/Load:**
+- Saving progress persists data
+- Loading restores correct state
+- Cloud sync works correctly

+
+## Why Leaderboards Are Post-Launch
+
+### Technical Complexity
+Leaderboards require significant infrastructure that would delay the entire project:
+
+| Component | Complexity | Time Required |
+|-----------|------------|---------------|
+| Backend API (Firebase/PlayFab) | High | 30-50 hours |
+| Anti-cheat system | Very High | 20-30 hours |
+| Cross-platform integration | High | 15-25 hours |
+| Security auditing | High | 10-15 hours |
+| Load testing at scale | Medium | 10-15 hours |
+| Challenge generation system | Medium | 15-20 hours |
+| Friends list integration | Medium | 10-15 hours |
+| **TOTAL** | | **110-180 hours (3-4 weeks)** |
+
+### Development Philosophy
+**Focus on Core First:**
+- Players need a polished, stable core experience at launch
+- Leaderboards are enhancement, not requirement for fun
+- Single-player roguelite is complete without competitive features
+- Meta-progression (Hangar upgrades) provides retention at launch
+
+**Risk Mitigation:**
+- Launching with untested backend infrastructure = high risk of crashes
+- Cannot properly load test until live player base exists
+- Security vulnerabilities in leaderboards could compromise entire game
+- Bugs in leaderboard system would overshadow positive launch reception
+
+**Community Building:**
+- Leaderboards are more meaningful with established player community
+- Launching with 100 players competing is less engaging than 5,000+
+- Post-launch "big update" generates press coverage and sales bump
+- Builds anticipation and gives players something to look forward to
+
+### Business Benefits
+**Launch Clean:**
+- Reviewers focus on core gameplay, not buggy leaderboards
+- Simpler support burden (no backend issues to troubleshoot)
+- Faster bug fixes (fewer systems to maintain)
+- Better first impression
+
+**Post-Launch Engagement:**
+- "Major Free Update" marketing opportunity
+- Re-engages lapsed players
+- Attracts new players with "now has leaderboards" messaging
+- Demonstrates ongoing development commitment
+

+- **Alternative:** Use platform-native leaderboards (Steam) as interim solution
+
+---
+
+## Key Takeaways
+
+1. **Launch is Week 12** - Core game only, no leaderboards
+2. **Leaderboards are Week 17-19** - Post-launch, after stability proven
+3. **Focus on Quality** - Better to launch polished core than rush complex systems
+4. **Community First** - Build player base before adding competitive features
+5. **Free Updates** - All post-launch content is free, no DLC paywalls
+6. **Iterative Approach** - Learn from each update before adding complexity
+
+---
+
+**Questions about launch plan? See:**
+- `ROADMAP_12W.md` - Detailed week-by-week breakdown
+- `GDD.md` - Full game design document
+- `Leaderboard/` folder - All leaderboard documentation

+# Clean Architecture for Unity
+
+**Project:** The Invasion Reforged  
+**Engine:** Unity + C#  
+**Goal:** Clean, testable, multiplayer-ready code  
+**Testing:** Unit tests for everything (TDD)
+
+---
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### SOLID in Unity
+
+**Single Responsibility**
+One class, one job:
+
+```csharp
+// ❌ BAD: God class doing everything
+public class Player : MonoBehaviour {
+    void Update() {
+        HandleInput();
+        Move();
+        Shoot();
+        TakeDamage();
+        CollectScrap();
+        LevelUp();
+    }
+}
+
+// ✅ GOOD: Separated concerns
+public class PlayerShipController : MonoBehaviour {
+    private IPlayerInput _input;
+    private IMovementSystem _movement;
+    private IWeaponSystem _weapons;
+    private IHealthSystem _health;
+}
+```
+
+#### Open/Closed
+Extend, don't modify:
+
+```csharp
+// Weapon base class
+public abstract class WeaponBase : ScriptableObject {
+    public abstract void Fire(Vector3 position, Vector3 direction);
+    public abstract float GetCooldown();
+}
+
+// New weapons added without modifying existing code
+public class PlasmaBeamWeapon : WeaponBase {
+    public override void Fire(Vector3 position, Vector3 direction) {
+        // Plasma beam implementation
+    }
+}
+
+public class IonCannonWeapon : WeaponBase {
+    public override void Fire(Vector3 position, Vector3 direction) {
+        // Ion cannon implementation
+    }
+}
+```
+
+#### Liskov Substitution
+Derived classes fully swappable:
+
+```csharp
+public interface IEnemy {
+    void Initialize(Vector3 spawnPosition);
+    void UpdateBehavior(float deltaTime);
+    void TakeDamage(float amount);
+    void Die();
+}
+
+// All enemies implement same interface
+public class FalconEnemy : MonoBehaviour, IEnemy { ... }
+public class SentryEnemy : MonoBehaviour, IEnemy { ... }
+public class AtlasEnemy : MonoBehaviour, IEnemy { ... }
+
+// Spawner doesn't care about concrete type
+public class EnemySpawner {
+    public void SpawnEnemy(IEnemy enemyPrefab, Vector3 position) {
+        IEnemy enemy = Instantiate(enemyPrefab);
+        enemy.Initialize(position);
+    }
+}
+```
+
+#### Interface Segregation
+Small, focused interfaces:
+
+```csharp
+// ❌ BAD: Fat interface
+public interface IGameEntity {
+    void Move();
+    void Shoot();
+    void TakeDamage(float amount);
+    void CollectScrap();
+    void LevelUp();
+}
+
+// ✅ GOOD: Segregated interfaces
+public interface IMovable {
+    void Move(Vector3 direction, float speed);
+}
+
+public interface IDamageable {
+    float CurrentHealth { get; }
+    float MaxHealth { get; }
+    void TakeDamage(float amount);
+    void Die();
+}
+
+public interface ICollector {
+    void CollectScrap(int amount);
+}
+
+public interface ILevelable {
+    int CurrentLevel { get; }
+    int CurrentXP { get; }
+    void AddExperience(int amount);
+}
+```
+
+#### Dependency Inversion Principle
+Depend on abstractions, not concretions:
+
+```csharp
+// ❌ BAD: Tight coupling
+public class PlayerShipController : MonoBehaviour {
+    private KeyboardInput _input; // Concrete class
+    
+    void Update() {
+        Vector2 move = _input.GetMovementInput();
+    }
+}
+
+// ✅ GOOD: Dependency injection
+public class PlayerShipController : MonoBehaviour {
+    private IPlayerInput _input; // Abstract interface
+    
+    public void Initialize(IPlayerInput input) {
+        _input = input; // Can be local, networked, AI, replay...
+    }
+    
+    void Update() {
+        Vector2 move = _input.GetMovementInput();
+    }
+}
+```
+
+---
+
+## Multiplayer-Ready Architecture
+
+### Network Abstraction Layer
+
+```csharp
+// Game state that will need network sync in future
+[System.Serializable]
+public struct GameState {
+    public int currentWave;
+    public float timeElapsed;
+    public int totalEnemiesKilled;
+    public int totalScrapCollected;
+    
+    // Serializable for network transmission
+    public byte[] Serialize() { ... }
+    public static GameState Deserialize(byte[] data) { ... }
+}
+
+[System.Serializable]
+public struct PlayerState {
+    public Vector3 position;
+    public Quaternion rotation;
+    public Vector3 velocity;
+    public float health;
+    public float shield;
+    public int scrapCount;
+    public int level;
+    
+    // Network sync ready
+    public byte[] Serialize() { ... }
+    public static PlayerState Deserialize(byte[] data) { ... }
+}
+```
+
+### Input Abstraction (Ready for Co-op)
+
+```csharp
+// Input interface (works for local, network, AI, replay)
+public interface IPlayerInput {
+    Vector2 GetMovementInput();
+    bool GetDashPressed();
+    bool GetAbility1Pressed();
+    bool GetAbility2Pressed();
+    bool GetAbility3Pressed();
+}
+
+// Local player implementation
+public class LocalPlayerInput : IPlayerInput {
+    public Vector2 GetMovementInput() {
+        float x = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
+        float y = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");
+        return new Vector2(x, y);
+    }
+    
+    public bool GetDashPressed() => Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space);
+    public bool GetAbility1Pressed() => Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Q);
+    public bool GetAbility2Pressed() => Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.E);
+    public bool GetAbility3Pressed() => Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.R);
+}
+
+// Future networked player implementation
+public class NetworkedPlayerInput : IPlayerInput {
+    private PlayerInputPacket _latestInput;
+    
+    public Vector2 GetMovementInput() => _latestInput.movement;
+    public bool GetDashPressed() => _latestInput.dashPressed;
+    // ... receives input from network
+}
+
+// AI implementation (for testing or single-player companions)
+public class AIPlayerInput : IPlayerInput {
+    private Vector2 _targetDirection;
+    
+    public Vector2 GetMovementInput() => _targetDirection;
+    // ... AI logic
+}
+```
+
+### Command Pattern (Network-Replayable)
+
+```csharp
+// All player actions as commands
+public interface IPlayerCommand {
+    void Execute(PlayerShipController player);
+    uint GetTimestamp(); // For network sync
+}
+
+public class MoveCommand : IPlayerCommand {
+    public Vector2 direction;
+    public float deltaTime;
+    public uint timestamp;
+    
+    public void Execute(PlayerShipController player) {
+        player.Move(direction, deltaTime);
+    }
+    
+    public uint GetTimestamp() => timestamp;
+}
+
+public class FireWeaponCommand : IPlayerCommand {
+    public Vector3 position;
+    public Vector3 direction;
+    public uint timestamp;
+    
+    public void Execute(PlayerShipController player) {
+        player.FireWeapon(position, direction);
+    }
+    
+    public uint GetTimestamp() => timestamp;
+}
+
+// Command queue (can be replayed for client prediction/rollback)
+public class CommandQueue {
+    private Queue<IPlayerCommand> _commands = new Queue<IPlayerCommand>();
+    
+    public void Enqueue(IPlayerCommand command) {
+        _commands.Enqueue(command);
+    }
+    
+    public void ExecuteAll(PlayerShipController player) {
+        while (_commands.Count > 0) {
+            IPlayerCommand cmd = _commands.Dequeue();
+            cmd.Execute(player);
+        }
+    }
+}
+```
+
+### Event-Driven Decoupling (Network-Friendly)
+
+```csharp
+// Centralized event system (easy to replicate over network)
+public static class GameEvents {
+    // Player events
+    public static event Action<int> OnPlayerLevelUp;
+    public static event Action<int> OnScrapCollected;
+    public static event Action<float> OnPlayerDamaged;
+    public static event Action OnPlayerDied;
+    
+    // Enemy events
+    public static event Action<EnemyType, Vector3> OnEnemyKilled;
+    public static event Action<int> OnWaveCompleted;
+    
+    // Upgrade events
+    public static event Action<UpgradeData> OnUpgradeApplied;
+    public static event Action<UpgradeData> OnPermanentUpgradePurchased;
+    
+    // Boss events
+    public static event Action<int> OnBossPhaseChange;
+    public static event Action OnBossDefeated;
+    
+    // Invoke methods (can be gated for network authority)
+    public static void PlayerLevelUp(int newLevel) {
+        OnPlayerLevelUp?.Invoke(newLevel);
+    }
+    
+    public static void ScrapCollected(int amount) {
+        OnScrapCollected?.Invoke(amount);
+    }
+    
+    // ... etc
+}
+
+// Systems listen to events
+public class UIManager : MonoBehaviour {
+    void OnEnable() {
+        GameEvents.OnPlayerLevelUp += HandleLevelUp;
+        GameEvents.OnScrapCollected += HandleScrapCollected;
+    }
+    
+    void OnDisable() {
+        GameEvents.OnPlayerLevelUp -= HandleLevelUp;
+        GameEvents.OnScrapCollected -= HandleScrapCollected;
+    }
+    
+    void HandleLevelUp(int newLevel) {
+        // Update UI
+    }
+    
+    void HandleScrapCollected(int amount) {

+# The Invasion: Reforged - Game Design Document
+
+**Genre:** Roguelite space shooter (Vampire Survivors-like)  
+**Platform:** PC, iOS, Android  
+**Developer:** Anderson Gonçalves (solo)  
+**Target:** Players who like arcade action with progression
+
+---
+
+## Game Concept
+
+### The Pitch
+You're an alien pilot defending your species from invading humans. Each run is a fight to survive, evolve, and get stronger for the next attempt.
+
+### How It Works
+- Start with a basic ship
+- Kill enemies and collect scrap
+- Level up during runs and pick temporary upgrades
+- Survive waves and boss fights
+- Die and return to your Hangar
+- Spend scrap on permanent upgrades
+- Go again, but stronger
+
+### Main Features
+- Auto-fire combat with active abilities
+- Roguelite progression (temporary + permanent)
+- 5 planetary arenas with environmental effects
+- Entropy Matrix system for better loot
+- Clean architecture for easy updates
+
+---
+
+## Setting & Atmosphere
+
+### The World
+Space battles around different planets. Each arena has a planet in the background to make it feel big and lonely.
+
+### Planetary Arenas
+
+#### Early Access Launch (v0.8 - 3 Arenas)
+| Planet | Visual Identity | Gameplay Effect |
+|--------|----------------|-----------------|
+| **Aureon Prime** | Orange cosmic dust | Reduced visibility |
+| **Cryovex** | Blue fog with floating ice | Human projectiles move slower |
+| **Voltra-9** | Intense red sun | Gradual damage if player remains stationary |
+
+#### Content Update 1 (Weeks 15-16 - +2 Arenas)
+| Planet | Visual Identity | Gameplay Effect |
+|--------|----------------|-----------------|
+| **Zerion Nexus** | Human metallic structures | Stationary turrets and radar interference |
+| **Ethereal Void** | Distorted space | Unstable gravity and curved projectile paths |
+
+### The Feel
+You're alone. Last ship of your species fighting off humans who think you're the invaders. It's survival, not heroics.
+
+---
+
+## Core Gameplay
+
+### Movement
+- **PC:** WASD to move, Space to dash
+- **Mobile:** Left joystick to move, right button to dash
+- Physics feel like zero-gravity - momentum and drift
+- Ship auto-rotates on mobile
+
+### Combat
+
+**Auto Weapons**
+Your ship fires automatically. No aiming needed - focus on positioning and staying alive.
+
+**Active Abilities**
+Special powers on cooldown that you trigger manually:
+- **Singularity Ray:** Laser beam that pierces through enemies
+- **Reflect Field:** Shield that bounces projectiles back
+- **Gravitational Burst:** Area damage pulse
+
+### Enemy Waves
+Human fleets spawn from the edges and come after you. Waves get denser over time.
+
+---
+
+## Weapons & Abilities
+
+### Automatic Weapons
+| Type | Name | Description |
+|------|------|-------------|
+| **Plasma Beam** | Pulse Beam | Auto-targeting shots that seek nearby enemies |
+| **Defensive Drone** | Orbital Sentinel | Continuously fires while orbiting your ship |
+| **Ion Cannon** | Ion Burst | Circular explosion of pure energy |
+
+### Active Abilities (Cooldown-based)
+| Type | Name | Description | Cooldown | Mobile Control |
+|------|------|-------------|----------|----------------|
+| **Focused Laser** | Singularity Ray | Continuous piercing beam | 8 seconds | Tap icon (right side) |
+| **Reactive Shield** | Reflect Field | Reflects projectiles for 3 seconds | 12 seconds | Tap icon (right side) |
+| **Gravity Dash** | Void Step | Teleport short distance, leaving gravity well | 6 seconds | Tap icon (right side) |
+
+### Upgrade Synergies
+Weapons can evolve and combine during runs. Example: Pulse Beam + Ion Burst = Plasma Nova (periodic automatic explosions around the ship).
+
+---
+
+## Enemy Types
+
+### Basic Enemies
+| Type | Name | Behavior | Health | Threat Level |
+|------|------|----------|--------|--------------|
+| **Light Fighter** | Falcon Mk I | Attacks in groups, orbiting the player. Fragile but numerous. | Low | ⭐ |
+| **Orbital Drone** | Sentry-03 | Maintains distance, fires guided missiles | Medium | ⭐⭐ |
+| **Heavy Bomber** | Atlas | Advances slowly, drops energy mines. High resistance. | High | ⭐⭐⭐ |
+| **Defense Turret** | Aegis Node | Stationary, fires linear beams | Medium | ⭐⭐ |
+| **Kamikaze Interceptor** | Raven-IX | Suicide ships that accelerate toward player | Low | ⭐⭐⭐ |
+
+### Raven-IX - Detailed Mechanics
+**Visual Design:**
+- Glowing engines
+- Compact body with vibrating blades
+- Red flashing light before detonation
+
+**Audio:**
+- Short siren warning
+- Growing energy charge sound
+- Heavy metallic explosion with spatial distortion effect on impact
+
+**Gameplay Function:**
+- Forces constant movement and tactical prioritization
+- Creates dangerous "denial zones" in the arena
+- Punishes static positioning
+
+### Boss Unit
+**Prometheus - Capital Ship**
+
+#### Early Access Launch (v0.8 - 2 Phases)
+- **Phase 1:** Deploys auxiliary drones while firing spread patterns
+- **Phase 2:** Activates shield generators that must be destroyed
+- **Reward:** Massive scrap payout and guaranteed epic upgrade
+
+#### Content Update 2 (Weeks 17-19 - +3rd Phase)
+- **Phase 3:** Direct assault with devastating beam weapons
+- **Additional Mechanics:** Enraged state with faster attacks and new patterns
+
+---
+
+## Progression System
+
+### Alien Scrap (Main Resource)
+**How It Works:**
+- Metal fragments drop from destroyed enemies
+- Blue light pulse when collected
+- Metallic echo sound
+- Counter shows on HUD
+- Keep 70% when you die
+
+### Upgrade Menu - The Hangar
+**What It Looks Like:**
+- Dark industrial space
+- Repair drones floating around
+- Energy in the pipes
+- Holographic upgrade panels
+
+**Animation:** Scrap turns to blue liquid and gets absorbed into your ship.
+
+---
+
+## Permanent Upgrades
+
+### Xenonic Integrity Core
+**What It Does:** Stronger hull, more shields, faster base speed
+
+**Cost:** 100-500 scrap per level  
+**Max:** 10 levels
+
+### Primary Combat Protocols
+**What It Does:** Unlocks new auto-weapons and makes them stronger
+
+**Cost:** 250-1000 scrap  
+**Effect:** New weapon types and better damage
+
+### Advanced Tactical Subsystems
+**What It Does:** Makes your active abilities better
+
+**Cost:** 150-800 scrap per level  
+**Effect:** Faster cooldowns, longer duration, more power
+
+### Quantum Entropy Matrix
+**What It Does:** Better loot drops during runs
+
+**Cost:** 300-1000 scrap per level  
+**See details below**
+
+### Adaptive Gravitational Field
+**What It Does:** Collect scrap from further away
+
+**Cost:** 100-400 scrap per level  
+**Max:** 5 levels
+
+### Biomechanical Evolution Synthesis
+**What It Does:** Changes your ship's biology for better stats
+
+**Cost:** 500-1500 scrap per level  
+**Max:** 8 levels  
+**Effect:** More damage, faster healing, better fire rate
+
+---
+
+## Quantum Entropy Matrix
+
+### The Idea
+*"Humanity believes in chance. We program it."*
+
+Ancient alien tech that bends probability. Makes rare upgrades show up more often during runs.
+
+### How It Looks
+- Purple glowing core
+- Floats in distorted gravity
+- Quantum particle effects
+
+### How It Sounds
+- Temporal fold sound on rare drops
+- Deep harmonic hum when active
+
+### Upgrade Tiers
+| Level | Effect | Cost |
+|-------|--------|------|
+| I | +5% Rare | 300 scrap |
+| II | +10% Rare / +3% Epic | 500 scrap |
+| III | +15% Rare / +7% Epic | 700 scrap |
+| IV | +20% Rare / +10% Epic | 1000 scrap |
+
+**Strategy:** Upgrading this early makes later runs way more powerful.
+
+---
+
+## Visual & Audio Design
+
+### Graphics
+**Art Style:**
+- 3D with neon and particles
+- Blues, purples, greens on black space
+- Huge planets in background, floating debris
+
+**UI:**
+- Holographic menus
+- Alien symbols
+- Glowing indicators
+- Everything has subtle glow
+
+**Ships:**
+- Organic curves + tech
+- Glowing energy in hull
+- Visual changes as you upgrade
+
+### Sound
+**Music:**
+- Spatial synthwave
+- Gets intense with combat
+- Ambient space drones when calm
+
+**Effects:**
+| Event | Sound |
+|-------|-------|
+| Scrap pickup | Metallic ping |
+| Level up | Rising pulse |
+| Explosions | Heavy impact |
+| Rare upgrade | Temporal distortion |
+| Ship damage | Biomech strain |
+| Active ability | Energy release |
+
+---
+
+## Architecture (SOLID Principles)
+
+### Single Responsibility
+Each system does one thing:
+- `MovementSystem`: Ship movement
+- `WeaponSystem`: Firing and projectiles
+- `EnemyAISystem`: Enemy behavior
+- `CollectionSystem`: Resource gathering
+- `UpgradeSystem`: Stat changes
+- `LeaderboardSystem`: Scores (post-launch)
+
+### Open/Closed
+Add new stuff without changing old code:
+- Abstract base classes for weapons and enemies
+- Data-driven configurations in JSON/ScriptableObjects
+- Plugin architecture for new upgrade types
+
+### Liskov Substitution Principle (L)
+All game objects follow common contracts:
+- All enemies implement `IEnemy` interface
+- All weapons implement `IWeapon` interface
+- All collectibles implement `ICollectable` interface
+
+### Interface Segregation Principle (I)
+Small, specific interfaces prevent unnecessary dependencies:
+- `IDamageable`: Health and damage handling
+- `ICollectable`: Pickup and collection logic
+- `IPoolable`: Object pooling for performance
+- `ITargetable`: Enemy targeting system
+- `ILeaderboardEntry`: Score submission and validation (post-launch)
+- `ILeaderboardProvider`: Platform-specific leaderboard integration (post-launch)
+
+### Dependency Inversion Principle (D)
+Core systems depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations:
+- Systems reference interfaces, not specific classes
+- Dependency injection for service location
+- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
+
+### Benefits for Solo Development
+Even as a one-person project, SOLID principles ensure:
+- **Maintainability:** Easy to find and fix bugs
+- **Scalability:** Simple to add new content
+- **Testability:** Individual systems can be tested in isolation
+- **Clarity:** Code remains understandable months later

+## 13.5. LEADERBOARD SYSTEM
+
+> **⚠️ POST-LAUNCH FEATURE (Content Update 3)**  
+> **Implementation Timeline:** Weeks 17-19 (after initial release)  
+> **Rationale:** Due to system complexity (backend infrastructure, anti-cheat, cross-platform sync), leaderboards will be developed and deployed as a free content update after the core game is stable and launched. This allows focus on core gameplay polish for initial release.
+

+# Risk Register
+
+**Project:** The Invasion: Reforged  
+**Last Updated:** November 3, 2025  
+**Review:** Weekly (Sundays)
+
+---
+
+## Risk Matrix
+
+**Probability:** Low (10-30%) | Medium (30-60%) | High (60-90%)  
+**Impact:** Low (<1 week delay) | Medium (1-2 weeks) | High (3+ weeks or project kill)
+
+---
+
+## Critical Risks
+
+### RISK-001: No Buffer in Timeline
+**Type:** Schedule  
+**Probability:** High (70%)  
+**Impact:** High (3+ weeks or quality cut)  
+**Status:** MITIGATED (2-week buffer added)
+
+**The Problem:**
+Original 17-week timeline had zero slack. Any delay breaks launch.
+
+**What Triggers It:**
+- Get sick for a week+
+- Unity breaking change
+- Art takes 7 weeks not 6
+- Boss/arena takes longer than expected
+
+**What We're Doing:**
+- Extended to 19 weeks (weeks 18-19 = buffer)
+- Identified scope cuts (3 arenas not 5, 2-phase boss not 3)
+- Weekly tracking to catch slippage early
+
+**If It Still Goes Wrong:**
+1. Cut to 2 arenas (saves 44-64 hours)
+2. Remove boss (saves 30 hours)
+3. Delay launch 1-2 weeks
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Check:** Week 6 (Dec 15)
+
+---
+
+### RISK-002: Scope Creep During Coding
+**Type:** Scope  
+**Probability:** High (60%)  
+**Impact:** Medium-High (1-3 weeks delay)  
+**Status:** ⚠️ MONITORING
+
+**Description:**
+Easy to add "just one more enemy" or "one more upgrade" during Weeks 7-14.
+
+**Triggers:**
+- Cool idea during development
+- Playtester feedback suggesting new features
+- Seeing similar games with more content
+
+**Mitigation:**
+- ✅ Feature Freeze defined (Week 11 - Jan 20)
+- ✅ GDD locked (no new enemies/upgrades/arenas after Week 11)
+- 🔄 Weekly scope review during Sunday check-ins
+
+**Warning Signs:**
+- Adding tasks to Week 12-14 that aren't bug fixes
+- "This will only take 2 hours" (famous last words)
+- Thinking "we need this to compete"
+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+- Any new feature ideas go into "Post-Launch Content Update" backlog
+- If already implemented: Cut lowest-value feature to reclaim time
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Week 10 checkpoint (validate scope adherence)
+
+---
+
+## HIGH RISKS (Medium-High Probability or Impact)
+
+### RISK-003: VHS Filter Performance Issues
+**Category:** Technical  
+**Probability:** Low (20%)  
+**Impact:** Medium (1 week delay to create fallback)  
+**Status:** 🟢 MONITORING
+
+**Description:**
+VHS post-processing filter may tank framerate on target hardware (GTX 1060).
+
+**Triggers:**
+- Week 3 profile shows <45 FPS with filter enabled
+- Mobile devices drop below 30 FPS
+
+**Mitigation:**
+- ✅ Week 3 performance testing planned (MASTER_PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE.md)
+- ✅ Fallback shader ready (simpler scanlines-only effect)
+- 🔄 Weekly profiling ritual (Fridays)
+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+1. Disable chromatic aberration (most expensive effect)
+2. Reduce scanline resolution
+3. Use fallback shader (scanlines + vignette only)
+4. Worst case: Remove filter, embrace pure low-poly aesthetic
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Week 3 (Nov 18-24) - Profile with filter
+
+---
+
+### RISK-004: Boss Fight Takes Longer Than Estimated
+**Category:** Schedule  
+**Probability:** Medium (40%)  
+**Impact:** Medium (1-2 weeks delay)  
+**Status:** ⚠️ MITIGATED (2-phase boss instead of 3)
+
+**Description:**
+Week 13 allocates 30 hours for boss. Multi-phase bosses often take 2x longer.
+
+**Triggers:**
+- Phase transitions buggy
+- Shield generators don't destroy properly
+- Boss AI more complex than expected
+- Balancing takes multiple iterations
+
+**Mitigation:**
+- ✅ Boss simplified to 2 phases (3rd phase = Content Update 2)
+- ✅ 2-week buffer available if needed
+- 🔄 Week 10 checkpoint validates basic enemy AI before boss work
+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+1. Use 2-week buffer for boss completion
+2. Simplify to 1-phase boss (just spawns drones + attacks)
+3. Cut boss entirely, replace with "Super Wave" (50+ enemies)
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Week 13 (Jan 27 - Feb 2) - Boss implementation week
+
+---
+
+### RISK-005: Mobile Control Scheme Fails Playtesting
+**Category:** Design  
+**Probability:** Medium (30%)  
+**Impact:** Medium (1 week to redesign + retest)  
+**Status:** 🟢 MONITORING
+
+**Description:**
+Virtual joystick feels bad, buttons in wrong places, or auto-aim too aggressive.
+
+**Triggers:**
+- Week 2 prototype playtest feedback: "This is frustrating"
+- Week 9 mobile build: Players can't dodge effectively
+- High death rate compared to PC players
+
+**Mitigation:**
+- ✅ Mobile Controls Design Doc created (MOBILE_CONTROLS_DESIGN.md)
+- ✅ Week 2 dedicated to control prototyping
+- ✅ 3 playtesters lined up for Week 2 feedback
+- 🔄 Alternative control scheme documented (tap-to-move)
+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+1. Switch to Scheme B (tap-to-move)
+2. Increase auto-aim assist (soft → hard lock-on)
+3. Add "Easy Mode" with stronger auto-aim for mobile
+4. Worst case: PC-only launch, mobile delayed to Content Update 4
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Week 2 (Nov 11-17) - Control prototype playtest
+
+---
+
+### RISK-006: Save System Corruption or Loss
+**Category:** Technical  
+**Probability:** Low (15%)  
+**Impact:** High (player rage, negative reviews, 1+ week to fix)  
+**Status:** 🟢 MONITORING
+
+**Description:**
+Save system bug causes players to lose 10+ hours of meta-progression.
+
+**Triggers:**
+- Game crashes during save write
+- Cloud sync conflict (playing on 2 devices)
+- Unity build changes PlayerPrefs path
+- File system error (out of disk space)
+
+**Mitigation:**
+- ✅ Save system robustness planned (Week 11)
+- ✅ Save versioning for future updates
+- ✅ Checksum validation to detect corruption
+- 🔄 Multiple save slots (auto-backup)
+
+**Warning Signs:**
+- Players report "progress reset" in Discord/reviews
+- Save file size = 0 bytes (corrupted write)
+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+1. Hotfix patch within 24 hours
+2. Implement cloud save recovery tool
+3. Offer "Skip to Wave 10" cheat code as compensation
+4. Public apology + free Content Update 1
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Week 11 (Jan 20-26) - Save system testing
+
+---
+
+## 🟡 MEDIUM RISKS (Lower Probability or Impact)
+
+### RISK-007: Unity LTS Breaking Change
+**Category:** Technical  
+**Probability:** Low (10%)  
+**Impact:** Medium (1 week to update or rollback)  
+**Status:** 🟢 MONITORING
+
+**Description:**
+Unity 2022.3 LTS update introduces breaking API change or critical bug.
+
+**Mitigation:**
+- ✅ Pin Unity version (2022.3.12f1 - current)
+- ✅ Test updates in separate branch before merging
+- ✅ Git allows rollback to previous Unity version
+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+- Stay on current version until post-launch
+- Report bug to Unity, wait for hotfix
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Monthly (check Unity release notes)
+
+---
+
+### RISK-008: Art Takes 7 Weeks Instead of 6
+**Category:** Schedule  
+**Probability:** Medium (30%)  
+**Impact:** Low-Medium (1 week delay, covered by buffer)  
+**Status:** 🟢 MONITORING
+
+**Description:**
+Week 1-6 art phase runs over schedule due to modeling complexity or iteration.
+
+**Triggers:**
+- Week 6 checkpoint: Not all models complete
+- VHS filter requires extra polish (looks unfinished)
+- Hangar scene more complex than expected
+
+**Mitigation:**
+- ✅ Week 6 checkpoint for go/no-go decision
+- ✅ 2-week buffer absorbs 1-week overrun
+- 🔄 Weekly progress tracking (Sunday check-ins)
+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+1. Use 1 week of buffer (still have Week 19)
+2. Cut lowest-priority models (Hangar props, environmental debris)
+3. Simplify VHS filter to fallback shader
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Week 6 (Dec 15) - Art Complete checkpoint
+
+---
+
+### RISK-009: Marketing Bandwidth Overload (Week 15-17)
+**Category:** Schedule  
+**Probability:** Medium (40%)  
+**Impact:** Low (DevLogs delayed, but game still launches)  
+**Status:** ⚠️ MITIGATED (pre-record voiceovers)
+
+**Description:**
+Week 15-17 requires: DevLogs, trailer, Steam page, builds, bug fixes. Too much.
+
+**Triggers:**
+- DevLog 1 recording takes 2 days instead of 1
+- Trailer editing requires re-shoots
+- Critical bug found during Week 16, needs immediate fix
+
+**Mitigation:**
+- ✅ Pre-record DevLog voiceovers in Week 10-11
+- ✅ Week 15-17: Just edit footage (much faster)
+- ✅ 2-week buffer provides extra time if needed
+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+1. Delay DevLog 2 to Week 18 (post-launch)
+2. Use AI voiceover (ElevenLabs) if voice recording fails
+3. Simplify trailer (60 seconds instead of 90)
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Week 14 (Feb 9) - Launch prep planning
+
+---
+
+### RISK-010: Playtesting Reveals "Not Fun" Core Loop
+**Category:** Design  
+**Probability:** Low (15%)  
+**Impact:** High (2-4 weeks to redesign or pivot)  
+**Status:** 🟢 MONITORING
+
+**Description:**
+Week 10 "First Playable" checkpoint: Gameplay feels tedious/boring.
+
+**Triggers:**
+- Playtesters: "It's okay, I guess"
+- High death rate but no "one more run" urge
+- Movement feels sluggish or combat unsatisfying
+
+**Mitigation:**
+- ✅ Week 10 checkpoint specifically validates fun factor
+- ✅ Vampire Survivors formula is proven (low risk)
+- 🔄 Early prototype (Week 7-9) catches issues early
+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+1. Increase movement speed 20-30%
+2. Add screen shake + particle effects (juice up combat)
+3. Adjust enemy spawn rates (faster ramp-up)
+4. Worst case: Pivot to simpler arena survival (no meta-progression)
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Week 10 (Jan 13-19) - First Playable checkpoint
+
+---
+
+### RISK-011: Solo Developer Burnout
+**Category:** Human  
+**Probability:** Medium (35%)  
+**Impact:** Medium (1-2 weeks lost productivity)  
+**Status:** 🟢 MONITORING
+
+**Description:**
+19 weeks at 45 hours/week = 855 hours. Risk of mental/physical exhaustion.
+
+**Triggers:**
+- Working 60+ hour weeks consistently
+- Skipping weekends for weeks 12-14 (crunch)
+- Feeling "I don't want to open Unity today"
+
+**Mitigation:**

+
+**Contingency Plan:**
+1. Take 3-day weekend (use buffer time)
+2. Reduce hours to 30/week for 1 week (recovery)
+3. Cut scope further (2 arenas, no boss)
+4. Delay launch by 1-2 weeks (health > deadlines)
+
+**Owner:** Anderson  
+**Next Review:** Weekly (Sunday check-ins include burnout assessment)

+```
+┌────────────────────────────┐

+└────────────────────────────┘
+
+Left thumb: Bottom-left 25% of screen
+Right thumb: Bottom-right 25% of screen
+```
+
+**Design Principle:** All interactive elements MUST be in bottom 40% of screen.
+
+---
+
+## 🎮 Control Schemes
+
+### Scheme A: Virtual Joystick (Recommended)
+
+**Movement:**
+- Virtual joystick on left side
+- Appears on first touch (doesn't need fixed position)
+- Drag to move, release to stop
+- Visual feedback: Circle expands in drag direction
+
+**Abilities:**
+- 3 fixed buttons on right side
+- Tap to activate
+- Cooldown overlay shows remaining time
+- Pulsing glow when ready
+
+**Dash:**
+- Integrated into joystick (swipe outward = dash in that direction)
+- Alternative: Dedicated 4th button on right side
+
+**Pros:**
+- ✅ Familiar to mobile gamers
+- ✅ Precise directional control
+- ✅ Works well with auto-fire combat
+
+**Cons:**
+- ❌ Requires two hands
+- ❌ Thumbs cover ~15% of screen
+
+---
+
+### Scheme B: Tap-to-Move (Alternative)
+
+**Movement:**
+- Tap anywhere on left 50% of screen
+- Ship moves toward tap point
+- Hold to continuously move
+
+**Abilities:**
+- Same as Scheme A (right side buttons)
+
+**Pros:**
+- ✅ Less screen occlusion
+- ✅ Easier for casual players
+
+**Cons:**
+- ❌ Less precise movement
+- ❌ Harder to dodge quickly
+- ❌ Not standard for action games
+
+**Decision:** Use Scheme A (Virtual Joystick) unless Week 2 prototype reveals issues.
+
+---
+
+## ♿ Accessibility Features
+
+### Hand Size Adaptation
+
+**Button Scaling:**
+- Small hands: Buttons 20% larger, closer to corners
+- Large hands: Buttons normal size, slightly inward
+- Detection: User setting in Options menu
+
+### One-Handed Mode (Optional - Decide by Week 2)
+
+**Concept:** All controls on one side (left OR right)
+
+```
+ONE-HANDED MODE (Left Hand):
+┌────────────────────────────┐
+│                            │
+│                            │
+│        [Arena]             │
+│                            │
+│  🔵                        │
+│  ⚡                        │ ← All controls
+│  🛡️                        │   on one side
+│  🚀                        │
+└────────────────────────────┘
+```
+
+**Pros:**
+- ✅ Play on bus/train (one hand free)
+- ✅ Accessibility for players with limited hand mobility
+
+**Cons:**
+- ❌ More screen occlusion (one thumb area)
+- ❌ Less precise (joystick + buttons close together)
+- ❌ Extra UI code complexity
+
+**Decision:** **Defer to post-launch** unless Week 2 playtesting shows strong demand.
+
+---
+
+## 🎯 Auto-Aim Assistance
+
+**Problem:** Touch controls less precise than gamepad/mouse.
+
+### Option 1: No Assist (Pure Player Skill)
+- Weapons fire in movement direction
+- Player must position correctly
+- **Pros:** Skill-based, rewarding
+- **Cons:** Frustrating on mobile, may feel unfair
+
+### Option 2: Soft Lock-On (Recommended)
+- Weapons aim toward nearest enemy within 30° cone
+- Player still needs to be "close enough"
+- Visual indicator (subtle arrow) shows lock-on target
+- **Pros:** Feels good, not "cheating"
+- **Cons:** May prioritize wrong enemy sometimes
+
+### Option 3: Hard Lock-On (Too Easy)
+- Weapons auto-target nearest enemy (any direction)
+- No player aiming needed
+- **Pros:** Super accessible
+- **Cons:** Removes skill, boring
+
+**Decision:** **Implement Option 2 (Soft Lock-On)** - Test in Week 2 prototype.
+
+---
+
+## 🧪 Testing Plan
+
+### Week 2: Control Prototype
+**Goal:** Validate core movement + ability activation feel good
+
+**Test Scene:**
+- Empty arena
+- Virtual joystick + 1 test button
+- 3 stationary target dummies
+- Metrics: Can tester hit all 3 targets within 20 seconds?
+
+**Success Criteria:**
+- [ ] Joystick feels responsive (<50ms latency)
+- [ ] Button taps register reliably (no missed inputs)
+- [ ] No thumb fatigue after 5 minutes of testing
+- [ ] Tester says "this feels good"
+
+**If Failed:** Adjust button sizes, positions, or consider Scheme B (tap-to-move).
+
+---
+
+### Week 9: First Mobile Build
+**Goal:** Validate controls in real gameplay with enemies
+
+**Test Scenario:**
+- Full combat: player vs 5 enemies
+- One arena, 3-minute session
+- Test on 2 devices: iPhone (small) + Android tablet (large)
+
+**Success Criteria:**
+- [ ] Player can dodge enemy attacks reliably
+- [ ] Ability buttons accessible without looking down
+- [ ] No accidental button presses
+- [ ] 60 FPS maintained during combat
+
+---
+
+### Week 13: Full Mobile QA Pass
+**Goal:** Test complete game on multiple device sizes
+
+**Test Devices (Minimum 3):**
+- Small phone: iPhone SE / Galaxy A32 (4.7-5.5")
+- Large phone: iPhone 14 / Galaxy S23 (6-6.7")
+- Tablet: iPad / Galaxy Tab (9-11")
+
+**Test Cases:**
+- [ ] Complete run start-to-finish (15+ minutes)
+- [ ] All 3 abilities used in combat
+- [ ] No UI overlap or clipping
+- [ ] Buttons accessible in landscape + portrait
+- [ ] Works with phone case (adds thickness)
+
+---
+
+### Week 16: Device Compatibility Testing
+**Goal:** Catch edge cases on unusual devices
+
+**Test Matrix:**
+| Device | Screen Size | Aspect Ratio | Notes |
+|--------|-------------|--------------|-------|
+| iPhone 8 | 4.7" | 16:9 | Minimum spec |
+| iPhone 14 Pro Max | 6.7" | 19.5:9 | Notch handling |
+| Galaxy S23 Ultra | 6.8" | 20:9 | Punch-hole camera |
+| iPad 9th Gen | 10.2" | 4:3 | Tablet landscape |
+| Galaxy Z Fold | 7.6" | 21.6:18 | Foldable (weird ratio) |
+
+---
+
+## 📊 Technical Implementation Notes
+
+### Unity Input System (New Input System)
+
+**Input Action Asset:**
+```
+Actions/PlayerControls:
+- Movement (Vector2) → Touch Position 0
+- Ability1 (Button) → Touch Position 1
+- Ability2 (Button) → Touch Position 2
+- Ability3 (Button) → Touch Position 3
+```
+
+**Touch Handling:**
+```csharp
+// Mobile input implementation
+public class MobilePlayerInput : IPlayerInput {
+    private VirtualJoystick _joystick;
+    private TouchButton[] _abilityButtons;
+    
+    public Vector2 GetMovementInput() {
+        return _joystick.GetDelta(); // Returns -1 to 1 range
+    }
+    
+    public bool GetAbility1Pressed() {
+        return _abilityButtons[0].WasPressedThisFrame;
+    }
+    
+    // ... etc
+}
+```
+
+### UI Canvas Settings
+
+**Canvas Scaler:**
+- Mode: Scale With Screen Size
+- Reference Resolution: 1920×1080
+- Match: 0.5 (balance width/height)
+- Reason: Handles wide range of aspect ratios
+
+**Virtual Joystick:**
+- Prefab: UI → EventSystem → Virtual Joystick
+- Anchors: Bottom-left corner
+- Pivot: (0, 0)
+- Size Delta: (240, 240) at 1920×1080 reference
+
+---
+
+## 🎨 Visual Design
+
+### Joystick Appearance
+- Outer ring: Semi-transparent white circle (30% opacity)
+- Inner knob: Solid cyan circle (#00FFCC)
+- Drag feedback: Outer ring pulses when touched
+- Movement trail: Subtle particle effect in drag direction
+
+### Ability Buttons
+- Shape: Circles (not squares—easier to hit on touch)
+- Background: Dark gray (#222222, 80% opacity)
+- Icon: White symbols (⚡ 🛡️ 🚀)
+- Active state: Cyan glow (#00FFCC)
+- Cooldown state: Gray overlay with timer text
+
+### Touch Feedback
+- Visual: Button scales to 110% on press, back to 100% on release
+- Haptic: Light haptic pulse on button press (iOS/Android vibration API)
+- Audio: Subtle "click" sound (50% volume)
+
+---
+
+## ⚙️ Settings & Customization
+
+### Control Settings Menu
+
+**Adjustable Parameters:**
+- [ ] Joystick size (80% / 100% / 120%)
+- [ ] Button size (80% / 100% / 120%)
+- [ ] Joystick opacity (30% / 50% / 70%)
+- [ ] Haptic feedback (On / Off)
+- [ ] Button layout (Default / Swapped for left-handed)
+
+**Presets:**
+- Default (100% size, 50% opacity)
+- Large (120% size, 70% opacity) — For small phones
+- Minimal (80% size, 30% opacity) — For tablets
+
+---
+
+## 🚨 Known Issues & Mitigations
+
+### Issue 1: Thumb Drift
+**Problem:** Joystick thumb slips off during long sessions  
+**Mitigation:** Joystick "recenters" to current thumb position if dragged >150px from origin
+
+### Issue 2: Accidental Button Presses
+**Problem:** Palm/thumb accidentally hits ability buttons  
+**Mitigation:** Buttons require 100ms press duration (not instant tap)
+
+### Issue 3: Screen Occlusion
+**Problem:** Thumbs cover 10-15% of playable area  
+**Mitigation:** Camera slightly zoomed out on mobile (10% more view distance)
+
+### Issue 4: Aspect Ratio Extremes
+**Problem:** 21:9 phones (Galaxy S23) have very wide screens  
+**Mitigation:** Canvas Scaler Match = 0.5 (scales proportionally)
+
+---
+

+# Early Access Strategy
+
+**Project:** The Invasion: Reforged  
+**Plan:** Early Access → Full Release  
+**Created:** November 3, 2025
+
+---
+
+## Why Early Access Works Here
+
+### What's Wrong with Traditional Launch
+
+Traditional v1.0:
+- Must ship "complete" - pressure to include all 5 arenas and 3-phase boss
+- No player feedback - design locked in
+- One shot at launch - hard to recover if it flops
+- 19 weeks until revenue - cash flow delayed
+
+Early Access:
+- Ship MVP - 3 arenas and 2-phase boss is enough
+- Get player feedback - iterate on real data
+- Multiple launch moments - each update brings new players
+- Revenue at week 14 - fund the rest of development
+
+---
+

+
+**Changes from original plan:**
+- Launch week 14 instead of 19
+- 3 arenas is enough for EA
+- 2-phase boss works for EA
+- "More content coming" is the whole point of EA

+├─ Price increase ($7.99 → $9.99)
+└─ Launch on additional platforms (Epic, consoles?)
+```
+
+---
+
+## Business Side
+
+### Revenue
+- EA Price: $7.99 (20% off full $9.99)
+- Early adopter bonus: Exclusive ship skin
+- Cash from week 14 funds the rest
+- Lower risk: Can pivot if sales suck
+
+### Marketing
+- Multiple launches: Each update gets Steam visibility

+- Week 25+: Full Release v1.0
+
+**Update players weekly:**
+- "This week: Working on Zerion Nexus arena"
+- "Bug fixes based on your reports"
+- "Next update ETA: 2 weeks"
+
+---
+
+## 🎯 Success Metrics (Early Access)
+
+### Week 1-2 Post-Launch
+- **Sales:** 100-500 copies (realistic for indie EA)
+- **Reviews:** 75%+ positive (Very Positive on Steam)
+- **Retention:** 40%+ players return Day 2
+- **Session Length:** 20+ minutes average
+
+### Week 4 (First Update)
+- **Sales Bump:** +50-100% sales spike on update day
+- **Reviews:** Maintain 75%+ positive
+- **Engagement:** 30%+ active players (played in last week)
+
+### Week 12 (Leaderboards Update)
+- **Sales:** 1,000+ total copies (word of mouth + updates)
+- **Reviews:** 80%+ positive (content updates = happy players)
+- **Retention:** 25%+ still playing (core fans)

+### Week 16 (Full Release)
+- **Sales:** 2,000-5,000 total copies
+- **Reviews:** 80%+ positive (polished, content-complete)
+- **Press:** Covered by indie game sites ("EA success story")
+
+---
+
+## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation (Early Access Specific)
+
+### Risk: "Early Access = Abandoned Project" Stigma
+**Mitigation:**
+- Weekly dev updates (even if small)
+- Public roadmap with realistic dates
+- Deliver on promises (hit update ETAs)
+- Full transparency about timeline
+
+### Risk: Negative Reviews ("Not Enough Content")
+**Mitigation:**
+- Explicit roadmap on Steam page
+- Emphasize "complete core loop, more content coming"
+- Price reflects EA status ($7.99 not $9.99)
+- Engage with reviewers, address feedback
+
+### Risk: Early Players Burn Out Before Full Release
+**Mitigation:**
+- Don't over-promise ("New content every week!" = burnout)
+- Space updates 2-3 weeks apart (time to digest)
+- Add optional challenges, not mandatory grind
+- Save major features (leaderboards) for later (brings players back)
+
+### Risk: Can't Exit EA (Perpetual Development Hell)
+**Mitigation:**
+- **Hard deadline:** Week 25 = Full Release v1.0 (no matter what)
+- Minimum viable roadmap (not endless feature adds)
+- "Full Release" = leaderboards + 5 arenas + 3-phase boss (achievable)
+
+---
+
+## 📋 Updated Production Schedule (Early Access)
+
+### REVISED TIMELINE: 14 Weeks to Early Access Launch
+
+```
+PHASE 1: ART (6 weeks) ← UNCHANGED
+Week 1-6: Model everything (ships, enemies, arenas, UI)
+Checkpoint: All art complete (Dec 15)
+
+PHASE 2: CODE (5 weeks) ← SHORTENED FROM 8 WEEKS
+Week 7: Core systems (movement, combat)
+Week 8: Enemy AI (3 types)
+Week 9: Progression + meta-progression
+Week 10: Basic boss (2 phases) + 3 arenas
+Week 11: FEATURE FREEZE
+
+PHASE 3: EA LAUNCH (3 weeks) ← SHORTENED FROM 5 WEEKS
+Week 12: Polish + bug fixes
+Week 13: EA page, demo, trailer
+Week 14: EARLY ACCESS LAUNCH (Feb 2, 2026)
+
+PHASE 4: EA CONTENT UPDATES (Weeks 15-24)
+Week 15-16: Content Update 1 (2 arenas)
+Week 17-19: Content Update 2 (boss 3rd phase)
+Week 20-24: Content Update 3 (leaderboards)
+
+PHASE 5: FULL RELEASE (Week 25+)
+Week 25: Exit Early Access (Full v1.0)
+```
+
+**Key Savings:**
+- Code phase: 8 weeks → 5 weeks (cut boss 3rd phase, 2 arenas)
+- Launch phase: 5 weeks → 3 weeks (no "perfect" polish needed)
+- Total to EA: 14 weeks (saves 5 weeks vs. original 19-week plan)
+
+---
+
+## 💡 Why This is BETTER Than Original Plan
+
+### Original Plan (19 Weeks to Full v1.0)
+- ❌ No revenue until Week 19
+- ❌ No player feedback until Week 19
+- ❌ High pressure to be "perfect" at launch
+- ❌ One shot at success
+- ❌ 5 arenas, 3-phase boss = high risk
+
+### Early Access Plan (14 Weeks to EA)
+- ✅ Revenue from Week 14 onward
+- ✅ Player feedback from Week 14 (shape future updates)
+- ✅ Lower pressure ("it's Early Access, more coming")
+- ✅ Multiple launch moments (each update = new sales spike)
+- ✅ 3 arenas, 2-phase boss = achievable, polished
+
+**Bottom Line:**
+- **Faster to market** (14 weeks vs. 19 weeks)
+- **Lower risk** (validate market before full investment)
+- **Better outcomes** (real feedback shapes development)
+- **More revenue** (EA price + full release price bump)
+
+---
+
+## ✅ Decision: Early Access or Traditional Launch?
+
+### Early Access (RECOMMENDED)
+**Pros:**
+- Launch 5 weeks sooner (Week 14 vs. Week 19)
+- Revenue starts earlier
+- Player feedback shapes final game
+- Multiple marketing moments
+- Lower pressure (explicit "more coming")
+
+**Cons:**
+- "Early Access" stigma (some players avoid)
+- Must deliver on roadmap promises
+- Requires ongoing communication/updates
+
+**Best For:** Solo dev, first commercial game, iterative design
+
+---
+
+### Traditional v1.0 Launch
+**Pros:**
+- "Complete" game at launch (better reviews?)
+- One marketing push (simpler)
+- No ongoing commitment (ship and move on?)
+
+**Cons:**
+- 5 weeks longer to revenue
+- No player feedback before launch
+- Higher pressure (must be "perfect")
+- Miss opportunity for EA hype cycle
+
+**Best For:** Established studio, known IP, "complete vision"
+
+---
+

+# 📋 LEADERBOARD IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
+
+> **⚠️ POST-LAUNCH FEATURE - NOT IN INITIAL RELEASE**  
+> This document describes a comprehensive leaderboard system planned for **Content Update 3** (Weeks 17-19 after launch). Due to system complexity and the need to focus on core gameplay quality, leaderboards will be implemented after the initial release is stable.
+
+## What Was Added
+
+I've successfully integrated a comprehensive leaderboard system into your Game Design Document and development roadmap for "The Invasion Reforged". Here's what was added:
+
+---
+
+## 1. GDD Updates (GDD.md)
+
+### New Section 13.5: LEADERBOARD SYSTEM
+A complete, production-ready leaderboard design including:
+
+#### **Leaderboard Categories**
+- **5 Global Rankings (Persistent):**
+  - Highest Survival Time
+  - Maximum Enemies Defeated
+  - Highest Scrap Collected
+  - Fastest Boss Kill
+  - Longest Streak
+
+- **2 Challenge Types (Time-Limited):**
+  - Daily Challenge (24h fixed seed runs)
+  - Weekly Challenge (7-day modifier challenges)
+
+- **Friends Leaderboard:**
+  - Platform-integrated (Steam, Game Center, Google Play)
+  - Beat notifications
+
+#### **Visual Design**
+- Holographic terminal in Alien Hangar
+- Color-coded ranks (Gold/Silver/Bronze/Cyan)
+- Alien glyphs aesthetic matching game theme
+- Post-run rank achievement notifications
+
+#### **Technical Implementation**
+- Backend architecture (Firebase/PlayFab/AWS recommendations)
+- Anti-cheat measures (server validation, anomaly detection, replay storage)
+- Cross-platform sync system
+- Performance optimization strategies
+- Complete JSON data structure for score submission
+
+#### **Rewards System**
+- Achievement integration (5 new achievements)
+- Cosmetic rewards for top performers:
+  - Top 1000: "Chromatic Fade" ship pattern
+  - Top 100: "Void Crystal" hull effect
+  - Top 10: "Ethereal Champion" animated trail
+  - Daily/Weekly top performers: Exclusive skins
+
+#### **Mobile Considerations**
+- Separate mobile leaderboards (control parity)
+- Mobile-specific categories (Touch Precision Award)
+- Cross-platform viewing options
+
+#### **Future Expansion Roadmap**
+- **v1.1:** Seasonal Leaderboards (3-month seasons)
+- **v1.2:** Clan/Team Leaderboards
+- **v1.3:** Tournament Mode with cash prizes
+
+#### **Privacy & Compliance**

+
+### Post-Launch Content Update (Section 13)
+- Updated Content Update 3 reference to point to comprehensive system (Section 13.5)
+
+---
+
+## 2. Roadmap Updates (ROADMAP_12W.md)
+
+### New Post-Launch Section: Content Update 3 (Weeks 17–19)
+
+#### **Week 17: Backend Infrastructure (30–50h)**

+- Post-run rank notifications
+- Pagination and caching
+
+#### **Week 19: Challenge System & Social (30–50h)**
+- Daily/Weekly challenge system
+- Friends leaderboard integration
+- Reward system
+- Privacy settings
+
+#### **Week 19.5: Testing & Polish (15–25h)**
+- Load testing
+- Cross-platform testing
+- Mobile optimization
+- Community beta testing
+
+**Total Implementation Time: 110–180 hours (2.5–4 weeks)**
+
+---
+
+## 3. Quick Reference Document (LEADERBOARD_QUICK_REF.md)
+
+Created a standalone quick-reference guide with:
+- Core categories overview
+- Technical stack recommendations
+- API endpoint examples
+- Development checklist (5 phases)
+- Integration points with existing systems
+- Estimated timeline for solo developer
+
+---
+
+## Key Design Decisions
+
+### 1. **Premium, No-Monetization Approach**
+- Leaderboards enhance engagement without pay-to-win
+- Rewards are purely cosmetic
+- No loot boxes or premium currencies
+- Aligns with game's premium pricing model
+
+### 2. **Anti-Cheat Priority**
+- Multi-layered validation (server-side, checksums, anomaly detection)
+- Manual review for top 10 entries
+- Replay data storage for verification
+- Protects competitive integrity
+
+### 3. **Cross-Platform Considerations**
+- Separate mobile/PC leaderboards for fairness
+- Unified backend for easy management
+- Platform-specific fallbacks (Steam Leaderboards, etc.)
+- Cloud save integration for seamless experience
+
+### 4. **Social Engagement**
+- Friends leaderboards increase retention
+- Beat notifications create friendly competition
+- Daily/Weekly challenges provide fresh content
+- Community features without toxic elements
+
+### 5. **Scalability**
+- Regional servers for global audience
+- Caching and pagination for performance
+- Modular design allows future expansion (clans, tournaments)
+- Seasonal resets keep competition fresh
+
+---
+
+## Integration with Existing Systems
+
+### Hooks into Current Design:
+1. **Section 6 (Progression System):** Scrap collection metrics feed leaderboards
+2. **Section 10 (SOLID Architecture):** LeaderboardSystem follows established patterns
+3. **Section 11 (Development Timeline):** Post-launch fits after core polish
+4. **Section 13 (Monetization):** Aligns with premium model and community features
+5. **Section 15 (Success Metrics):** Adds engagement and retention tracking
+
+### New Code Systems Required:
+- `LeaderboardSystem`: Core submission/retrieval logic
+- `LeaderboardUI`: Hangar terminal and display screens
+- `ChallengeManager`: Daily/Weekly challenge generation
+- `AntiCheatValidator`: Score validation and flagging
+- `ILeaderboardProvider`: Platform abstraction interface
+
+---
+
+## Why This Implementation Works
+
+### For Players:
+✅ **Competitive Motivation:** Multiple categories = multiple ways to excel  
+✅ **Fresh Content:** Daily/Weekly challenges provide reasons to return  
+✅ **Social Connection:** Friends leaderboards without toxicity  
+✅ **Fair Competition:** Anti-cheat and separate mobile/PC ensures integrity  
+✅ **Rewarding:** Cosmetic rewards feel meaningful without being pay-to-win  
+
+### For You (Developer):
+✅ **Retention Boost:** Leaderboards proven to increase DAU/MAU metrics  
+✅ **Community Building:** Creates competitive scene and streamable moments  
+✅ **Marketing Value:** "Top 100" players become advocates  
+✅ **Modular Design:** Can deploy in phases (global → challenges → social)  
+✅ **Post-Launch Content:** Extends game life without new assets  
+
+### For SOLID Architecture:
+✅ **Single Responsibility:** Separate systems for submission/display/validation  
+✅ **Open/Closed:** New categories addable without core changes  
+✅ **Interface Segregation:** Platform providers implement minimal interfaces  
+✅ **Dependency Inversion:** Core logic independent of backend choice  
+
+---
+
+## Next Steps (When You're Ready to Implement)
+
+### Phase 1: Research & Planning (Before Week 17)
+1. Choose backend provider (Firebase = easiest, PlayFab = gaming-focused, AWS = most control)
+2. Set up developer accounts and test projects
+3. Sketch leaderboard UI mockups
+4. Define exact scoring formulas for each category
+
+### Phase 2: Backend Development (Week 17)
+1. Set up authentication system
+2. Create database schema for scores
+3. Implement submission endpoint with validation
+4. Deploy to dev environment and test with dummy data
+
+### Phase 3: Client Integration (Week 18)
+1. Build hangar terminal interaction
+2. Create leaderboard UI screens
+3. Connect to backend API
+4. Test with real gameplay data
+
+### Phase 4: Challenge System (Week 19)
+1. Implement seed generation for Daily Challenges
+2. Create modifier system for Weekly Challenges
+3. Add reward distribution logic
+4. Test challenge rotation
+
+### Phase 5: Testing & Launch (Week 19.5)
+1. Beta test with community
+2. Load test with simulated users
+3. Final security audit
+4. Marketing push with leaderboard trailer
+
+---
+
+## Potential Pitfalls & Mitigations
+
+### Pitfall 1: Backend Costs
+**Risk:** Leaderboard API calls could get expensive  
+**Mitigation:** Aggressive caching, pagination, regional servers with CDN
+
+### Pitfall 2: Cheating
+**Risk:** Top ranks filled with cheaters damages trust  
+**Mitigation:** Multi-layer anti-cheat, manual review for top 10, community reporting
+
+### Pitfall 3: Mobile vs PC Balance
+**Risk:** PC players dominate, mobile feels unfair  
+**Mitigation:** Separate leaderboards, mobile-specific categories, optional unified view
+
+### Pitfall 4: Low Participation
+**Risk:** Not enough players for competitive scene  
+**Mitigation:** Bot scores for first 2 weeks, focus on friends leaderboards initially
+
+### Pitfall 5: Development Time Overrun
+**Risk:** 180 hours could stretch to 250+  
+**Mitigation:** Phase rollout (global → challenges → social), cut tournament mode if needed
+
+---
+
+## Success Metrics (Track These)
+
+### Week 1 Post-Launch:
+- [ ] 20%+ of players view leaderboards
+- [ ] 10%+ submit at least one score
+- [ ] 5%+ attempt Daily Challenge
+
+### Month 1 Post-Launch:
+- [ ] 35%+ leaderboard engagement
+- [ ] 15%+ Daily Active Users participate in challenges
+- [ ] 10%+ of players return specifically for Weekly Challenge
+
+### Quarter 1 Post-Launch:
+- [ ] Top 1000 ranks filled on all categories
+- [ ] 50%+ of active players have submitted scores
+- [ ] Daily Challenge has 500+ participants daily
+- [ ] Zero critical exploits or cheats in top 100
+
+---
+
+## Files Modified/Created
+
+### Modified:
+1. ✅ **GDD.md** - Added Section 13.5 (Leaderboard System), updated Sections 10 & 13
+2. ✅ **ROADMAP_12W.md** - Added Post-Launch Weeks 17–19 detailed breakdown
+
+### Created:
+3. ✅ **LEADERBOARD_QUICK_REF.md** - Standalone quick reference guide
+
+---
+
+## Estimated ROI
+
+### Development Investment:
+- **Time:** 110–180 hours (2.5–4 weeks solo)
+- **Cost:** Backend hosting (~$20–50/month for first 5000 users)
+- **Opportunity Cost:** 1 month of other feature development
+
+### Expected Returns:
+- **Retention Increase:** +15–25% (industry average for leaderboards)
+- **Session Length:** +10–20% (players stay for "one more try")
+- **Social Sharing:** 2–3x more screenshots/videos shared
+- **Streamer Appeal:** Competitive leaderboards = streaming content
+- **Review Scores:** Community features often mentioned in positive reviews
+
+### Break-Even Analysis:
+If leaderboards retain just 100 additional players who each play 10 more hours:
+- That's 1000 additional player-hours of engagement
+- At $9.99 premium price, even 50 players = $500 revenue
+- Word-of-mouth from competitive community = long-tail sales
+
+**ROI: HIGH** ✅
+
+---
+
+## Final Recommendation
+
+**GO FOR IT** 🚀
+
+Leaderboards are a proven engagement multiplier for roguelites. Your game has:
+- ✅ Replayable core loop (perfect for leaderboards)
+- ✅ Clear performance metrics (survival time, kills, scrap)
+- ✅ Premium pricing (no monetization conflicts)
+- ✅ SOLID architecture (easy to integrate cleanly)
+- ✅ Cross-platform vision (leaderboards unify community)
+
+The 2.5–4 week investment post-launch will pay dividends in retention, community building, and long-term sales. The comprehensive design in Section 13.5 gives you a production-ready blueprint to execute efficiently.

+## Technical Notes
+
+### Firebase Free Tier Limits
+- **Spark Plan (Free):** 50k reads/day, 20k writes/day
+- **Blaze Plan (Pay-as-you-go):** $0.06 per 100k reads, $0.18 per 100k writes
+
+### Redis Cache Configuration
+- Top 1000 entries cached per category
+- 5-minute TTL (Time To Live)
+- Significantly reduces database load
+- Estimated 70-80% reduction in API calls
+
+### Regional Server Distribution
+- **NA:** North America (AWS us-east-1)
+- **EU:** Europe (AWS eu-west-1)
+- **ASIA:** Asia Pacific (AWS ap-southeast-1)
+- **OCE:** Oceania (AWS ap-southeast-2)
+- Regional replication increases costs ~30%
+
+### Anti-Cheat Statistical Thresholds
+- **Normal Range:** Within 3σ (standard deviations) of mean
+- **Suspicious:** 3σ to 5σ deviation → Flagged for manual review
+- **Obvious Cheat:** >5σ deviation → Automatic rejection + ban

+# 🏆 LEADERBOARD SYSTEM - QUICK REFERENCE
+
+> **⚠️ POST-LAUNCH FEATURE - NOT IN INITIAL RELEASE**  
+> **Status:** Planned for Content Update 3 (Weeks 17-19 post-launch)  
+> **Priority:** HIGH engagement feature, but deferred to ensure core game quality at launch
+
+## Implementation Priority: Post-Launch (Update 3)
+
+### Why Post-Launch?
+**Complexity Factors:**
+- Backend infrastructure setup and maintenance
+- Multi-platform integration (Steam, iOS, Android)
+- Robust anti-cheat system development
+- Cross-platform synchronization
+- Load testing and scaling considerations
+- Security auditing and penetration testing
+
+**Launch Focus:**
+- Core gameplay loop must be polished and stable
+- Single-player experience is complete without leaderboards
+- Meta-progression (Hangar) is the primary retention mechanism at launch
+- Leaderboards add competitive layer after community is established
+
+---
+
+## Core Categories
+
+### Global Leaderboards (Persistent)
+1. **Highest Survival Time** - How long you lasted
+2. **Maximum Enemies Defeated** - Total kill count
+3. **Highest Scrap Collected** - Resource gathering prowess
+4. **Fastest Boss Kill** - Prometheus defeat speed
+5. **Longest Streak** - Consecutive successful runs
+
+### Challenge Leaderboards (Time-Limited)
+1. **Daily Challenge** - 24-hour fixed seed runs
+2. **Weekly Challenge** - 7-day modifier challenges
+
+### Social
+1. **Friends Leaderboard** - Compare with your friends across all categories
+
+---
+
+## Technical Stack
+
+### Backend Options
+- **Primary:** Firebase/PlayFab/AWS GameLift (custom REST API)
+- **Fallback:** Platform-specific (Steam Leaderboards, Game Center, Google Play Games)
+
+### Anti-Cheat
+- Server-side validation
+- Anomaly detection (3σ deviation flagging)
+- Replay data storage for top 100
+- Checksum validation
+- Manual review for top 10
+
+### Data Structure
+```json
+{
+  "playerId": "unique_player_id",
+  "platform": "Steam|iOS|Android",
+  "timestamp": "ISO8601_datetime",
+  "category": "survival_time|enemies_defeated|scrap_collected",
+  "score": 1234,
+  "secondaryMetric": 567,
+  "runChecksum": "hash_value",
+  "gameVersion": "1.2.3",
+  "permanentUpgrades": { "hull": 5, "weapons": 3 }
+}
+```
+
+---
+
+## UI/UX Integration
+
+### Access Point
+- Holographic terminal in the Alien Hangar
+- Post-run summary screen shows rank achievements
+
+### Visual Design
+- Holographic data streams with alien glyphs
+- Color-coded ranks (Gold/Silver/Bronze/Cyan)
+- Animated entry transitions with particle effects
+- Platform icons (Steam/iOS/Android)
+
+### Display Information
+- Rank (with movement indicator)
+- Player name
+- Score/Time
+- Secondary stat
+- Achievement date
+
+---
+
+## Rewards System
+
+### Achievements
+- **Top Pilot** (Top 1000) - 20G
+- **Elite Squadron** (Top 100) - 50G
+- **Champion of the Void** (Top 10) - 100G
+- **Daily Warrior** (7 daily challenges) - 30G
+- **Friend Rivalry** (Beat all friends) - 25G
+
+### Cosmetic Rewards
+- **Top 1000:** "Chromatic Fade" ship pattern
+- **Top 100:** "Void Crystal" hull effect
+- **Top 10:** "Ethereal Champion" animated trail
+- **Daily Top 100:** Rotating 24h exclusive skins
+- **Weekly Top 10:** "Hall of Champions" emblem
+
+---
+
+## Mobile Considerations
+
+### Separate Leaderboards
+- Mobile platforms compete separately due to control differences
+- Optional "All Platforms" view available
+- Mobile-specific categories (Touch Precision Award, One-Handed Hero)
+
+---
+
+## Future Expansion
+
+### v1.1 - Seasonal Leaderboards
+- 3-month seasons with full resets
+- Hall of Fame archive
+- Season-exclusive cosmetics
+
+### v1.2 - Clan System
+- Clan leaderboards (max 50 members)
+- Aggregate scoring (top 10 members)
+- Monthly Clan Wars
+
+### v1.3 - Tournament Mode
+- Bracket-style elimination
+- Free weekly, premium monthly
+- Cash prizes for premium tournaments
+- Spectator mode
+
+---
+
+## Privacy & Compliance
+
+### Player Controls
+- Visibility toggle (opt out of global)
+- Username customization
+- Ghost mode (hide from friends)
+- Score history viewing
+
+### GDPR
+- Data deletion removes all entries
+- 12-month retention, then anonymization
+- No personal info beyond username
+
+---
+
+## Performance Targets
+
+### Optimization
+- Local cache (top 1000, 5-minute refresh)
+- Pagination (50 entries per page)
+- Regional servers (NA/EU/ASIA/OCEANIA)
+- Gzip compression for data transfer
+
+---

+ isink it# Devlog #01 — Timed VO Script & Cut Plan
+
+Title: Devlog #01 — Zero-G Movement & Auto-Fire — The Invasion Reforged
+Length target: 6:00 - 7:30 (aim ~6:30)
+Format: 16:9 (1080p) long-form devlog. Extract shorts from marked timestamps.
+
+Placeholders: replace <STEAM_WISHLIST>, <DISCORD_INVITE>, <FULL_DEVLOG_URL> before publishing.
+
+---
+
+0:00–0:08 Hook (8s)
+- Visual: Fast montage: before/after movement clip (0.5s each), close call with Raven-IX, scrap pickup, short UI level-up flash.
+- VO script: "Zero‑G movement is live — and it finally feels right." (energetic)
+- Text overlay: "Devlog #01 — Zero‑G Movement & Auto‑Fire"
+
+0:08–0:25 Intro (17s)
+- Visual: webcam face (optional) + game logo card
+- VO: "Hi, I'm [Your Name], solo dev of The Invasion Reforged. Welcome to Devlog #01. Today I'll show how I tuned ship movement and implemented the auto-fire weapons." (friendly, concise)
+- Lower-third: "[Your Name] — Solo Dev"
+
+0:25–0:45 Goal & Context (20s)
+- Visual: cut to gameplay slow pan
+- VO: "Goal for this session: add inertia for a floaty-but-responsive feel, and get the automatic weapons firing in a way that rewards positioning and upgrades." (clear)
+- On-screen bullets (short): "Goal: Inertia + Responsive Dash, Auto-fire weapons"
+
+0:45–2:10 Movement Deep Dive (1:25)
+- Visual: Show editor with movement parameters (acceleration curve, damping, top speed). Show pseudo-code snippet (highlighted) for 8–12s. Cut to gameplay showing drifting and corrections.
+- VO (scripted):
+  - "I modeled movement as a dampened velocity system. Instead of directly setting velocity, I apply acceleration toward the input direction and dampen existing velocity each frame. Here's the core idea:"
+  - (Show pseudo-code overlay)
+  - "Key tuning knobs: acceleration curve, damping factor, and top speed clamp. I used a non-linear acceleration curve (ease-out) so small inputs feel snappy but sustained input reaches top speed smoothly."
+- B-roll notes: show before/after clips (split-screen) for 6–8s to emphasize change.
+- On-screen callouts showing exact parameter values used in the build (example): Accel=14, Damping=0.92, TopSpeed=9, DashCooldown=6s, DashDistance=12.
+
+2:10–2:45 Dash Ability Explanation (35s)
+- Visual: gameplay clip showing dash escape vs. enemy; UI cooldown overlay animation
+- VO: "To complement inertia, I added a short dash with cooldown. This preserves risk—you can't spam the dash—while giving players a clutch option to avoid kamikaze interceptors." (practical tone)
+- Show small code snippet for dash activation and cooldown logic (2–3 lines) as overlay.
+
+2:45–3:45 Auto-Fire Weapons (1:00)
+- Visual: show WeaponSystem inspector (or script brief) then gameplay showing auto-fire behavior and different weapon pickups.
+- VO:
+  - "Weapons fire automatically based on your current loadout and level. The system chooses targets within a cone and fires according to weapon-specific rates."
+  - "I built the system to be data-driven: new weapons are ScriptableObjects (or JSON configs) defining fire rate, cone angle, projectile type, and scaling with level."
+- Visual callouts: show Pulse Beam, Orbital Sentinel, Ion Burst names with short clips.
+
+3:45–4:10 Upgrade Interaction (25s)
+- Visual: level-up selection pop-up during run, show choosing an upgrade and immediate effect.
+- VO: "When you level up, temporary run upgrades can change how your auto-weapons behave—like adding homing or creating an orbiter. These temporary changes stack with permanent Hangar upgrades." (concise)
+
+4:10–4:40 Problem & Fixes (30s)
+- Visual: show older footage where movement felt sluggish or weapons overpowered; add captions: "Problem: Sluggish feel" / "Problem: Overpowered Ion Burst".
+- VO: "Initial tuning made the ship feel sluggish. I increased responsiveness by adjusting the acceleration curve and added a dash to improve player agency. For weapons, I adjusted projectile spread and added level-scaling to avoid huge spike moments early." (honest, quick)
+
+4:40–5:10 Live Playthrough Clip (30s)
+- Visual: uninterrupted gameplay showcasing movement, dash, auto-fire, and scrap pickup — aim for an exciting sequence with a near-miss and a reward.
+- VO: light commentary or leave music + SFX; consider short live VO like: "Here’s a run where those small corrections matter—watch the Raven-IX approach and the dash to escape." (optional)
+
+5:10–5:40 Next Steps & Roadmap (30s)
+- Visual: show GDD hangar screen mock + bullets for next tasks
+- VO: "Next: enemy AI for Raven-IX, level spawn tuning, and the Hangar with permanent upgrades. Devlog #02 will focus on enemy AI and spawn design." (forward-looking)
+- On-screen CTA bullets: "Wishlist on Steam — <STEAM_WISHLIST>" "Join Discord — <DISCORD_INVITE>"
+
+5:40–6:00 End & CTA (20s)
+- Visual: end slate with social links, Subscribe CTA, Steam wishlist link in description shown as text
+- VO: "If you liked this, wishlist The Invasion Reforged and subscribe for weekly devlogs. Full devlog and code notes in the description. Thanks for watching!" (warm)

+Devlog #01 — Zero-G Movement & Auto-Fire (Short)
+
+Implemented a dampened velocity model to get zero-G movement that feels "floaty but responsive." Also added a short dash to give players a clutch option.
+
+Why it matters: small tweaks in acceleration and damping completely change the player's sense of control. If you tune these wrong, the game feels sluggish or twitchy.

+# Devlogs Strategy
+
+Guide for making dev logs (YouTube + LinkedIn) that build audience and get wishlists.
+
+Checklist (what I'll include)
+- Devlog goals and KPIs
+- Cadence and publishing schedule
+- Video structure and episode ideas aligned with the GDD
+- Recording, editing, and thumbnail best practices
+- YouTube upload checklist and description template
+- LinkedIn post template and repurposing plan
+- Short script templates and example first-devlog script
+- Metrics to track and next steps
+
+---
+
+## Goals & KPIs
+- Primary goals: Gain visibility, build trust around the solo dev story, generate Steam wishlists and mobile pre-orders.
+- Audience goals (first 3 months): 500 YouTube subscribers, 2k combined views across platform, 1k Steam wishlists (or equivalent).
+- Key metrics to track: views, average view duration, click-through rate (CTR on thumbnail), engagement (likes/comments/shares), subscribers gained per video, Steam wishlist conversion, LinkedIn impressions & engagement.
+
+---
+
+## Cadence & Schedule
+- Frequency: Weekly or bi-weekly (weekly recommended during early dev for momentum).
+- Duration: 5–12 minutes for full devlogs. Create 30–90s teaser clips for LinkedIn and short-form platforms.
+- Suggested publishing day/time: Tuesday or Thursday, 10–11 AM local time (experiment and iterate).
+
+Example 8-episode devlog plan aligned to your GDD timeline
+- Devlog 00 — Intro: Solo dev + high concept + roadmap (publish with GDD announcement)
+- Devlog 01 — Movement & Core Shooting Mechanics (Week 1 demo)
+- Devlog 02 — Enemy AI: Falcon Mk I & Sentry-03 (Week 1/2 demo)
+- Devlog 03 — Leveling & Temporary Upgrades (Week 2 demo)
+- Devlog 04 — Hangar & Permanent Upgrades (Week 3 demo)
+- Devlog 05 — Quantum Entropy Matrix Deep Dive (mechanics + design rationale)
+- Devlog 06 — Boss Design: Prometheus (design + prototype footage)
+- Devlog 07 — Polishing, mobile optimizations, and next milestones (release roadmap + wishlist CTA)
+
+---
+
+## Video Structure (repeatable format)
+1. Hook (0:00–0:15) — short visual tease: highlight the coolest/most surprising moment. One-sentence value: "Today I implemented the Quantum Entropy Matrix that increases rare drop chances."
+2. Intro (0:15–0:35) — 5–10s personal intro, project name, episode number.
+3. Progress demo (0:35–4:00+) — show gameplay or editor, explain what you changed. Keep camera/gameplay focused, use captions.
+4. Deep dive (2–5 minutes) — code/design decisions, trade-offs, short diagrams or clips of editor/config files.
+5. Problems & learnings (30–60s) — what failed, how you fixed (brevity = authenticity).
+6. Roadmap & next steps (20–40s) — what’s next and when the next devlog will be.
+7. CTA (10–20s) — wishlist on Steam, follow on YouTube/LinkedIn, subscribe, join Discord.
+8. End slate (5–10s) — social links and short music sting.
+
+Tips: keep energy up, speak to camera occasionally for personality, add captions for accessibility, show a short timelapse for long processes.
+
+---
+
+## Recording & Editing Best Practices
+- Video: 1920x1080 (60fps if gameplay looks smooth), use a capture bitrate of 10–20 Mbps for clear footage.
+- Audio: use a USB/XLR microphone with pop filter. Record audio at 44.1/48 kHz, 16–24 bit. Normalize and apply light compression & noise gate.
+- Webcam: optional, 720p minimum, place a small rounded webcam overlay.
+- Screen recording: record game 1080p; if possible, record editor windows separately for cutaways.
+- Editing software: DaVinci Resolve (free), Premiere Pro, or CapCut for mobile edits.
+- Editing checklist: trim dead air, add captions, add lower-thirds with episode number, include music (royalty-free), color grade gameplay for consistency, export H.264 MP4.
+
+---
+
+## Thumbnail & Title Guidelines
+- Resolution: 1280x720 (16:9). Keep important details inside a safe area (center 90%).
+- Design: bold readable text (30–60 px), high-contrast colors, big expressive face if using webcam, one dominant visual action from the game.
+- Text examples: "Building Quantum Loot Mechanics", "How I Made the Prometheus Boss", "Movement + Zero-G Inertia Explained".
+- Title formula: [Devlog #X] Short hook — The Invasion Reforged. Example: "Devlog #03 — Building Level-Up Loot Choices — The Invasion Reforged"
+
+---
+
+## YouTube Upload Checklist & Description Template
+- Upload checklist: craft a strong title, add compelling thumbnail, set visibility (public/scheduled), add tags, add chapters in description, add pinned comment linking to Steam wishlist/Discord, add end screen linking to playlist or subscribe, add card to related videos, add subtitles (auto-generated then fix), schedule cross-post on LinkedIn.
+
+YouTube description template (editable):
+```
+Devlog #01 — Movement & Auto-Fire

+
+Tags: "roguelite", "indie game dev", "game dev", "unity", "devlog", "The Invasion Reforged", "space shooter".
+
+---
+
+## LinkedIn Post Template & Strategy
+- Post type: short native video (30–90s) + short text body. On LinkedIn, short & insightful posts perform best. Also publish a longer article for larger lessons or case studies.
+- Frequency: 1–2 short posts per week (teasers + lessons), 1 longer article every 2–4 weeks.
+- Engagement strategy: tag relevant people/companies, use 3–6 hashtags (#GameDev, #IndieDev, #MadeWithUnity, #MobileGames), ask one open question to invite comments.
+
+LinkedIn post template (short):
+```
+Devlog #01 — Movement & Auto-Fire (Teaser)
+
+Implemented zero-g movement with slight inertia today. Small change but huge for how the game feels. 
+
+Lesson: tune acceleration and drag values to keep movement responsive but "floaty".
+
+Watch the full devlog on YouTube: <link>
+What would you tune first in a space shooter? 👇
+#GameDev #IndieDev #TheInvasionReforged
+```
+
+For full-text articles: expand on design trade-offs or technical deep dives (use diagrams and code snippets). Link back to the video and GDD stored in the repo.
+
+---
+
+## Repurposing Strategy
+- Create 3 short clips (15–60s) per devlog: gameplay highlight, biggest learning, and a code/design insight. Use these on LinkedIn, Instagram Reels, TikTok.
+- Post the short native video on LinkedIn for better reach than external links.
+- Post a pinned tweet/X with short clip + YouTube link and relevant hashtags.
+
+---
+
+## Script Templates
+Short outline (for 5–8 minute video):
+- Hook (1 line)
+- Intro (name + project + episode)
+- Problem/goal for this session
+- Demo: show before/after
+- How it’s implemented (high-level code/design)
+- What broke & how I fixed it
+- Next steps + CTA
+
+Example full micro-script (first devlog intro):
+```
+[Hook] I just implemented the zero-G movement and it finally feels right — here's why.
+
+Hi, I'm [Your Name], solo dev of The Invasion Reforged. This is Devlog #01.
+
+Goal today: add inertia to movement and tweak auto-fire so enemies feel threatening.
+
+Demo: (play footage) — you can see how the ship drifts and requires small corrections.
+
+Implementation: I used a simple dampened velocity model and clamped top speed. I prioritized feel over realistic physics because responsiveness is critical for fun.
+
+Problems: initial tuning made the ship feel sluggish; solved by adjusting the acceleration curve and adding a short dash ability.
+
+Next: work on enemy AI and initial level spawns. If you want the build, wishlist on Steam at: <link>.
+
+Thanks for watching — subscribe for weekly devlogs.
+```
+
+---
+
+## Example First Devlog Title, Description, and Hashtags
+- Title: "Devlog #01 — Zero-G Movement & Auto-Fire — The Invasion Reforged"
+- Short description: "In this devlog I implement inertia-based ship movement and the automatic weapon system. Watch gameplay, code notes, and tuning decisions."
+- Hashtags: #GameDev #IndieDev #Roguelite #Unity #TheInvasionReforged
+
+---
+
+## Metrics & Iteration
+- Track these per-episode: Views, watch time %, CTR, likes, comments, subscribers, Steam wishlist clicks.
+- After 3 videos, analyze which topics drove the most engagement and prioritize similar content.
+
+---
+
+## Next Steps I can help with (pick any)
+- Generate a full script for Devlog #01 (I can produce a timed script with VO lines and cut points).
+- Create a thumbnail mockup spec or produce example thumbnail text options.
+- Produce the YouTube description and LinkedIn post copy for Devlog #01.
+- Create short clip variants (15–60s) from an uploaded video (if you provide footage).
+- Add this DEVLOGS.md into your repository (done).
+
+If you want, tell me which next step to do and I will implement it now.
