## Recommendations

### For Future Documentation

1. **Maintain Professional Tone:** Avoid casual language, stay technical
2. **Be Concise:** If it can be said in fewer words, do so
3. **Focus on Essentials:** Only include information that affects decisions or implementation
4. **Use Tables:** For specifications, schedules, comparisons
5. **Assume Knowledge:** Reader has professional game dev experience
6. **No Fluff:** Every sentence should add value

### For This Project

**Keep:**
- Weekly updates to START_HERE.md
- GDD as single source of truth for design
- Architecture doc as implementation reference
- Schedule for timeline tracking

**Remove/Archive:**
- Overly detailed leaderboard specs (implement when needed, Week 20-24)
- Excessive marketing plans (execute when relevant)
- Tutorial-style explanations (team knows industry standards)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Update START_HERE.md weekly** with current week tasks
2. **Reference GDD.md** for all design decisions
3. **Follow UNREAL_CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE.md** for code patterns
4. **Track progress** against MASTER_PRODUCTION_SCHEDULE.md
5. **Archive old versions** if further changes needed

---

**All documentation now reflects professional AAA game development standards with 30 years industry experience perspective.**
