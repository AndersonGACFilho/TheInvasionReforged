# Week 2: Heavy Units & Boss Models

**Period:** Nov 11-17, 2025  
**Phase:** Art Production  
**Objective:** Complete heavy enemy variants and boss model

---

## Deliverables

By end of week:
- Atlas heavy bomber (1000-1500 tris)
- Raven-IX kamikaze (400-600 tris)
- Aegis turret (300-500 tris)
- Prometheus boss (2000-3000 tris, modular design)
- Week 1 model refinement complete
- All assets UV unwrapped and import-ready

**Total Time:** 42 hours (6-7h/day, 6 days)

---

## Daily Breakdown

### Monday-Tuesday: Atlas Heavy Bomber (10h)

**Specifications:**
- Triangle count: 1000-1500
- Size: 2x Falcon dimensions
- Design: Bulky, slow-moving appearance
- Colors: Gray hull, red warning lights
- Features: Multiple visible weapon hardpoints

**Quality Check:** Import next to Falcon in UE5. Must appear intimidating and significantly larger.

---

### Wednesday: Specialist Units (10h)

#### Raven-IX Kamikaze (6h)
- Triangle count: 400-600
- Design: Compact, streamlined, aggressive
- Features: Visible glowing explosive core, red flash lights
- Movement implication: High-speed aerodynamic form

#### Aegis Node Turret (4h)
- Triangle count: 300-500
- Design: Stationary defensive unit
- Features: Visible weapon barrel, industrial aesthetic
- Can be simplified if schedule pressured

---

### Thursday-Friday: Prometheus Boss (16h)

**Capital Ship Design:**
- Triangle count: 2000-3000 (largest asset)
- Modular architecture for phase system:
  - Main hull (persistent)
  - 4 shield generators (destroyable in phase 2)
  - Weapon emplacements (visual state changes)
- Aesthetic: Human military, contrasts with alien designs
- Scale: Must dominate screen space

**Quality Check:** Should feel like fighting a space station, not just a large ship.

---

### Saturday: Model Refinement (6h)

**Polish Week 1-2 Work:**
- Player ship topology and proportions
- Falcon and Sentry model cleanup
- Verify clean topology on all models
- Confirm UV unwrapping quality
- Fix asymmetry issues

**Standard:** All models should appear intentional, production-ready.

---

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] 4 new enemy models completed
- [ ] Boss has functional modular parts
- [ ] All models properly UV unwrapped
- [ ] Clear size hierarchy: Falcon < Atlas < Prometheus
- [ ] Week 1 models polished to production standard

---

## Risk Mitigation

**Boss complexity exceeds time budget:**
- Simplify phase 2 mechanics (reduce shield generators to 2)

**Models lack visual distinction:**
- Exaggerate silhouettes and size differences

**Schedule slippage:**
- Aegis turret is lowest priority, can be simplified or deferred
